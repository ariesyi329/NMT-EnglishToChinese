And I was 11 years old , and I remember one morning wake up , listening to my family .
My father was listening to my UNK radio television .
And he 's got a smile . It 's very small , because most of all news is going to be frustrated with him .
" The Taliban left ! " and the father was UNK .
I don 't know what it means , but I can see that my father is very , very happy .
" You can go to a school school now . " He said .
I never forget the morning .
A real school .
And I was six years old , and the Taliban was working on Afghanistan and decided to school for illegal .
And so after that five years , I had spent my sister and my sister , and my sister had never been able to get rid of the girls .
It 's the only way we have .
We don 't have the same thing that we 're going to know where we 're going to be going to know where we 're going to know where we 're going .
And we put it in the food UNK so that anybody thought we 're going to go shopping .
In school in a house , we have 100 people in a room .
And it 's very comfortable in winter , but it 's very hot .
We all know that it 's dangerous -- teachers , students and parents .
And sometimes after school , a few weeks ago , one week , very early in the Taliban .
We were always worried about the Taliban .
Are we tracking track ?
Do they know where they are ?
And we were scared , but we still wanted to go to school .
And I was fortunate enough to grow in a UNK family .
My grandfather was a remarkable man .
And he was born in Afghanistan , and there was a UNK with other people who insisted his daughter , my mother , who had been UNK his father .
But my mother and I became a teacher .
That 's her .
She was retired for two years ago , and it turned out to be a home school , a woman and a woman .
My father -- it was him -- he 's the first person in his family .
So it 's true that his kids should be educated , including his daughter , even though the Taliban , even though .
And for him , children don 't accept education is a bigger risk .
In the last year of the Taliban , I remember that sometimes I felt frustrated that my life was so scared that I was not able to see in the future .
And I thought about it , but my father would say , " Listen , my daughter , you can lose whatever you live in your life . "
Your money may be stolen , you may be fired out of war .
And the only thing you can see is this stuff , if we had to sell blood vessels to pay your family , we would be wrong .
But even if you still don 't ? "
I 'm 22 years old .
And I had been destroyed by the UNK years of war with decades .
And my older women , high school in high school , even if not my family , I would be like a lot of people .
And now I 've been a proud of this proud of pride .
And one of the great UNK in the United States , in the United States of America , is when I came back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , when I came to Afghanistan , my grandfather , and then , for the first time I had my grandfather , I had a UNK .
And he was not just because my college , when my college UNK , I was the first man in the women , and I was the first car on my UNK UNK UNK .
And my family , I was confident .
And my dream was big , but they were happier than my hope .
This is the reason that I became the UNK of UNK , which is a global organization for women .
And that is the reason that I 've been working on , which is the first thing , probably the UNK UNK in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , let 's get girls working on education .
And what struck me , I saw that I had students in my school in my school .
And as I saw their parents , especially their father , just like my dad , even though they had a fear in their faces .
For instance , this is not true , and I can 't see him in his face , and he 's the father of my student .
And there was a month before his daughter and his daughters had died from school in school , where they were killed by the road .
And he was in the house , he had a voice , and he had a voice on him , and he 'd be going to be going to be able to get to school school , and that 's what happened .
" If you think , you can kill me now , " he said , " But I 'm not going to destroy the mind behind my face and destroy my daughter 's future . "
And for Afghanistan , I realized that this is the Western state of the West -- it 's the father who had this success -- he understood that his son is the son of his daughter , and his father 's success , is his success .
And that 's not what the mothers are doing about our success .
And in fact , for the good future of girls , they 're usually the first UNK UNK , but in Afghanistan , we have to have a male .
And there was a hundred million girls who had been there for a few hundred people -- please forget , " It was illegal .
But today , Afghanistan and Afghanistan are more than three million of these girls .
Afghanistan and United States have a lot of different .
And what I discovered is that the United States can see what we 've changed .
And I fear that these changes in the United States will be able to save a lot of time .
But when I went back to Afghanistan and support my parents and encourage them , I saw the future of the future , I saw this change in the future .
For me , there was no hope in my life that had no hope of what was going to be me next than then .
Like I was , they had a big dream .
Thank you .
Everything that I do , whether it 's life or work in my life -- it 's a lot of older women working in the last seven years since then .
And I was a young man , but I was young , but actually I had a lot of UNK in my hometown , Kenya , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK Institute of UNK in the UNK of Africa .
And I was working in a Italian NGO , and we failed every single project in Africa , and we failed .
And I was immediately UNK .
And at the age of 21 , I think we were Japanese , we were doing something good at Africa .
And yet , what are we doing ?
And one of the first projects I wrote was a book called " The UNK of UNK , " in the project , we decided to teach UNK UNK in this project .
So , we take the seeds in Italy where a UNK , a beautiful valley , UNK UNK , where we teach people to grow in Italy and UNK and so on .
And of course , there was no interest in that , so we had to pay them all the time , and they would be a few times a few times a time .
There was this UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , and we were really surprised by this .
But we don 't ask them , but just say , " Let 's see it . "
" The UNK in UNK , " in UNK , UNK UNK in the line of the line . "
And of course , it 's a long time in Africa .
We 're beautiful . In Italy , a UNK .
It 's unbelievable . We talk about UNK and say , " Look , it 's very easy .
And when it 's heavy , it 's a pretty cool picture , and it goes from UNK to the last night where it 's going to cut off all the UNK all the UNK in the last half .
And we said , " Oh God , these are the UNK UNK ! "
And he said , " Yes , that 's why we 're not here . "
" Why don 't you say ? " You never ask . "
And I thought I had to say that there was only one of them in Africa , but when I know that the United States , the U.K. , the French , as I know it , it 's very proud of what we do with a lot of us .
Because , at least , we 've got a UNK .
You should be looking at the garbage -- well , you know how much food we have in the country where we trust these things .
You can read this book , it 's called the UNK , and the author is UNK UNK , a UNK economist .
This book was published in 2009 in 2009 .
And we 've been working for two billion dollars in the last 50 years since in the last 50 years .
And I 'm not going to tell you about the damage of that money .
You read yourself read .
Let 's see how big it is , how much damage we 've got .
We live in UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK , we have only two ways of one of them : one , two , three , 15 .
Two words come from the UNK of UNK , UNK , " the dad . "
But two words really look different .
And my parents ' UNK said that I wanted my kids to change my kids , " I love your kids . "
And so it meant that I had a different background in my cultural background that I was looking for .
And that 's why it 's called " The UNK , " which is the boss .
And I was reading a book about my book called " The UNK of UNK , " which is the first one of the first things , because people don 't want to help people , if people don 't want to help .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
And this morning , for the last morning , he put this UNK in the floor , and he said , " We can 't see if you can , can you imagine that if you can 't see a city of a new degree ? "
And when I was 27 , I had a commitment to the aid of people , and I set up a lot of work on people , and I set up a job called UNK , which is that we don 't do the same thing , but it 's about UNK .
So what we need to do -- it 's shut up .
When we walk into a community , it doesn 't leave any of the community with each other , but that 's how they sit with each other .
Our job is not in office .
We met with the nurses in a restaurant and a bar .
We didn 't have the infrastructure .
And what we do , is to be friends of them , and finding their interest .
And the most important thing is passion .
You can ask yourself to your own ideas .
But what if you 're not interested in ?
The passion is the passion of the passion , the most important thing .
The passion with each other is the basis of creating UNK , which is the most important thing .
And then we 'll help them collect knowledge and information , because the world is not the line of the line , the UNK .
There 's ideas that can be sure you need to understand knowledge , but we can provide support .
So a lot of years ago , I had a thought that we couldn 't see their ideas , rather than not to listen to what they were , rather than what we thought about it , but it doesn 't work with the community of the community .
I 'll tell you a secret .
The community had a problem .
The entrepreneurs who never did it , they never tell you , they wanted to put money on the back of their community , and then they wanted to do it for a lot .
So there 's a UNK .
You don 't even know the smartest people in the community , because they don 't belong to your public meetings .
And what we 've done is , for a client , for a young man , we have to build a new set of social infrastructure that we 've ever developed .
We 've got to create a whole new career .
And this is a professional family doctor , and this is a corporate doctor , and a company doctor , and if you 're in your kitchen , you 're going to be in your kitchen room , or to be able to help you , to help you , to bring your private passion into your UNK and help you .
And I had a study in UNK UNK in UNK .
And then I was reading Dr. UNK , trying to get rid of what was going on in my UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK
And my first year when I was in UNK , I had the first client , and I had my first client , who was the name of the house , and I had to get the UNK in my garage , and then I teach him what I was going to sell , and then I teach him what I was doing , " Are you going to help us ? "
And I 'm going to leave you with a UNK UNK , which is the UNK of UNK in the UNK , and then there are farmers who sold to Japan , and then there 's 40 million dollars a year , and then there 's a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was a farmer , and then there was
And after a year , I got 27 years , and the government came up to ask me , " What do you do ?
How you can tell me , " I did a very difficult thing .
And that 's the mouth . That 's what they said . "
So -- so the government said , " And then they do that . "
We started with 300 groups in the world .
And we 've been able to build UNK businesses .
And the new generation of entrepreneurs have been UNK by UNK .
In UNK , the greatest of the greatest management UNK UNK UNK , a couple of years ago , died in a few years ago .
It was a philosophy that had been a philosophy for a philosophy , Dr. UNK UNK , who said , " The project is actually about UNK and UNK economic economy . "
And the plan was to be a business company .
Now , what we do is we rebuild it , and we don 't know how many of the smartest people want to use their own money and energy .
We have to learn how to get these people out .
We 've got to give their UNK , and respect their privacy , and we need to be good at what they can do , and then they 'll be able to do that , and then they 'll be able to do that , and then they 'll be able to do that , and then they 'll be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be able to do that , and then they would be
In a UNK community , we have 200 customers .
Can you imagine a community of UNK , how much power is there ? Do you know how much intelligence and passion ?
And here you are asking for all your questions from who you are .
It 's a local UNK . You 're clapping for them .
And so what I wanted to say , is that it 's the UNK of UNK .
When we were in the beginning of the first revolution in the first revolution -- we used to be able to UNK fuel fuel , we used to be able to do this as well as possible , but we realized that it 's not sustainable .
The fuel fuel fuel needs is a UNK .
UNK food is not UNK .
What we 're going to care about is how we 're going to meet the food of food in a sustainable way , health , education , transportation and communications .
There 's nothing to do with this technology .
Who 's going to be able to invent the technology that 's going to be the green revolution ? Who ? Don 't .
Governments ? Don 't .
They are entrepreneurs who are working for themselves .
Many years ago , I saw a funny article in the magazine magazine .
There was a group of experts who had been invited to talk about what was going on in New York City .
And that was the UNK , and the team came together , and they had the UNK UNK in 100 years , and they said , " Well , two years after year , New York City will be there .
Why ? Because they looked at the graph on the graph , that if the population continues to this speed , people in New York City would be working on a UNK horse , and then there was no way of UNK food that would be good at six o 'clock in New York City .
And then people are going to be UNK .
So the UNK , they thought , was this dirty technology going to be living in New York .
So what happens ? 40 years after , in the United States , there was a UNK UNK in the United States .
And then there 's a new technology that can be developed and UNK and UNK and UNK and so many .
For example , New York City , New York City , New York City .
And yet , there 's a secret to do with entrepreneurs .
First of all , you 'll give them a promise .
Otherwise they wouldn 't come for you .
And then you get your passion for that passion .
You 're going to tell them about UNK .
Whether it 's a big company or a small company , it 's good for three things to do good : the product of the market is effective , the market is effective , financial management management management management .
What 's the problem ?
There is no man who can do UNK and UNK and financial jobs .
This man doesn 't exist .
It 's not born .
And we 've done that in a study of 100 companies in the world , UNK UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ,
And all of the world 's property has only one thing in common : There is nothing a business can be created by a company .
And now we 're going to see two pages in UNK UNK in England , and we started looking at the first two pages of what people used to say to them -- how many of those guys are using UNK UNK in the last two pages of how many times the two pages of " we 're using " the word " in the United States .
" No , no one of you , " we used 32 times .
And he was just the beginning of a UNK .
Nobody can build a corporate company . Nobody .
And so we can build a community , where we 've come from a UNK , and we 've come from a small corporate background , and we 'll ask , " What do you need you ?
What do you do ? Can you make it ?
Are you going to sell it ? Are you going to get money ? "
" Ah , I 'm going to do this . I 'm going to ask you to help me with your help ? "
We inspire groups of community groups .
And we 've got volunteers from the team who are going to help the entrepreneurs who are working for the customers , and the human community , we find out that the community of community can create a culture that can change the culture of the community and the economy , so you can do this whole thing , it 's going to change the community , it 's going to change the community , it 's going to change the environment , it 's going to be the whole thing , the imagination of the community , the human community , to be able to change the culture and the economy , the imagination , the imagination of the community , the human community , to be able to change the culture of the community of the community and the economy .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I had a UNK UNK in UNK .
And then there was this teacher that I wanted to talk to an UNK student in UNK .
And I was scared .
And I was so scared that they were UNK , and they had the UNK UNK that they read , and that they had come back then .
But as the conversation happened , my experience as a UNK in my UNK , as I saw it in my UNK , I saw that into a completely new world .
And that 's the feeling that my students and I love , and I love each other person with other ideas .
And I believe that in the end of the door is that there 's a good conversation with communication .
In order to change the world , we really need to see from our scientists and engineers to get good communication .
Our scientists and engineers are both the biggest of the problems that we face , and so forth , and so forth , if we don 't understand what it is , then I believe in the same way that we don 't understand it .
But if our scientists and engineers are not going to go to see their UNK , we don 't have a good conversation .
So scientists and engineers , please tell us what we 're talking about .
And so I wanted to share a couple of different ways , and tell you how to make sure that what you need to say to you as well as UNK , your engineering and your engineering .
The first answer to answer our question : What is the technology ?
Tell us why you 're science with us .
Don 't tell me what you study in my study , I 'll tell you about my research because the skeleton of this skeleton is about to know and treat .
And then when you describe scientific principles , you have to watch the term right now .
This is the term that we understand from one of your ideas .
And of course , you can say , " Well , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " about time and time , " is that easy to understand . "
The idea is simple and not UNK .
Instead , as Einstein said , would be simple as simple as possible as possible .
You don 't have to be able to change your mind , you know your scientific theory .
And to think about stories and stories and complexity -- these are all the way to talk about what we love and what we 're excited about .
And you can use a few slides to show you what you can do with this slide .
Do you want to know why there 's a UNK ?
What 's going on ? He killed , it 'll be killed .
It 's just boring that these slides don 't seem to be boring , but it 's dependent on the language of the brain that allows us to do it .
And this is a quick example from the UNK UNK , which gives us the special structure of a UNK structure , which is to say , is not inspired by the UNK of the UNK UNK .
And the trick here is to be a simple , UNK sentence , to be able to be able to see the point , then in a way , to allow us to be able to detect the image of what we 're looking for and what we 're looking for .
And so these things are I thought that you can help us open the UNK of the door and the design for engineering and engineering .
And so , because of the engineers that I 've been working with and I 've been working with my colleagues , I wanted to talk a little bit about this equation to come up with me .
And with this science that you 've been working with , you know , with the UNK and the term that you 're looking for , you 're talking about what you 're looking for , and then you 're UNK , and so when you 're in this wonderful job working with the audience , it 's going to be something that 's important and UNK interaction .
And so , scientists and engineers , when you solved this equation , there 's nothing to do with me .
Thank you .
And one of my favorites is called " The UNK UNK UNK . "
It 's not just bad . It sounds good .
And it means " a UNK of politicians . "
And although it 's a good definition in the last 19th century , he says , " There 's a guy who does this guy , he can do whatever he doesn 't know about it , but he doesn 't want to do anything about it , he doesn 't want to be any stage or whatever it is to be , but it doesn 't work on the stage , " it will be " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or
I don 't know what it means .
It 's called the UNK of words , which I think of as a hypothesis .
But it 's a very important thing to say that the political center is very important in the political center , and all of the politicians know that they had to try to control their words with control .
And for instance , until the president of England , it allowed us to be able to report about news about what it means to be the least of the political news that we 've been talking about .
And in fact , it 's because a man , this great name is called UNK UNK , which is the answer in Congress .
And he was UNK by his UNK , but he was a very brave man who had enough enough to put it on his boss , and then he ended up with a UNK voice on London and won .
And just a few years later , we had the first record in the word " UNK UNK UNK UNK . "
And a lot of people think it 's called metal .
No , it 's a news freedom for generations .
But to be honest with the word and political behavior , I want to leave you back to the United States , before it just announced .
And then they had a question for how to do it , their leaders .
They don 't know .
Who is the leader of UNK ?
And that problem was arguing about Congress for a long time .
And there 's a lot of advice that these advice may seem to be possible .
And I mean , some people wanted to call him the CEO , and then some of them call him the UNK of UNK , which is called the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the UNK .
There was no UNK name .
Some of you just say , he 's a king .
They think it 's the UNK with the past .
They don 't even have the UNK , their ideas , is that you can get a UNK in the king of the election .
You know , it 's probably possible .
And everybody was feeling UNK UNK , in fact , for three weeks , because it 's going on the debate for three weeks .
And I read a study in the poor ' 80s , the UNK record , which is , of course , is the subject of this issue . "
And the reason for UNK and depression is that it 's about the end of the UNK .
And George did not want to let me say that in Washington .
And they didn 't say he had the UNK or his UNK .
So they gave him a UNK , UNK , UNK .
This is called " UNK . "
" UNK , " they didn 't create this . I mean , it was like a conference , but it was a meeting .
It 's like a UNK UNK .
And it does not seem to be very , very , very UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK .
And even though a few hundred or a half of a few hundred different animals have said it was true for government , but it was a real title .
And that 's why it 's called the UNK .
And they said it was like , well , you can 't call him a meeting .
And this man was going to be UNK and UNK .
Who 's going to see him , if he only had a little bit like a UNK , like the UNK of the United States , he had the UNK of the United States .
And then three weeks ago , there was no left left .
And by the way , they agreed to be the UNK UNK , but they also wanted to be sure that they don 't agree with the identity of the UNK and the UNK and the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK of the UNK , that we don 't want to be considered as UNK as a UNK .
Now in this story , you can know about doing something interesting .
First of all , my favorite place , where I could find out that I could find out that there was no president of what had been said to be the president of the president .
UNK UNK , who was the president of the president , is now the UNK of UNK UNK in the beginning of the 18th century .
And then the second thing you can know is that when the American government claim that it 's just a temporary thing , it 's going to be difficult for UNK .
But the third thing you can know is that it 's very important , and I want to leave you back to this point , which is the name of the United States of America , right ?
And it 's about 25 million of them in half of the land , and there 's the largest economy in the world , and there 's the UNK of the UNK and the rest of the world .
The reality and the history of that story is a great mistake .
So the end of the end is going to win .
They get their UNK .
And one of the other things that happened to be worried about it , is that it sounds pretty funny when it happened .
But now , do you know how many countries there are now ?
UNK UNK .
And that 's because they wanted their name to listen to the guys who had about 5,000 UNK , etc . , etc .
And so then finally , there was a crash , because no one had ever been told when they were told that they were the United States of the U.S. government .
And this is a very important lesson , and I think you 're learning , and that 's what I want to leave you with .
And politicians have to choose to say that the word and control of the word and control reality , but in fact , it changes the way that humans change the reality .
Thank you very much .
And I was walking through 50 UNK of UNK UNK , and I was 19 years old and a UNK UNK UNK at the UNK of Florida .
And what I did was with my black UNK in my black and UNK UNK in my UNK , and I can 't see it with a very slow hole in my UNK .
This is the first time I was in Afghanistan .
And as soon as I grew up in the war in a war in my war , at the end of the day , at the end of the day , there was a UNK teacher , then the man who had to be in the UNK of the man who was going to come to school , and said , " You know , " the UNK , the UNK , the UNK . "
But that 's what it 's called .
And so I stood here in Afghanistan and God , and God gave birth to an UNK and a radical political artist and a radical and a radical artist , and in the last nine years it was working on the war of Afghanistan and art .
In Afghanistan , you can create a lot of beautiful stuff in art , but I don 't want to describe the UNK that I wanted to create , and I wanted to figure out that there was a moral theory in which I wanted to be able to control the identity of the identity of the identity of identity and to understand what it means to be .
And I wanted to say to be a man who lives in a day where he was wearing a UNK , and he was wearing a UNK with the religious and political corruption .
And these were the ones that had to go to the public vote , and they said , " Let 's ask me , " and I 'm going to say , " Don 't I say , " I 'm a UNK , " or " I 'm a UNK . "
And I tried to try to get the president of the UNK and the UNK of the UNK .
And one of the things that I wanted to do in my mind is called " The UNK of UNK , " which is about to build a UNK UNK in the streets of Iraq and to put the car back in the streets of UNK and then to say that there 's nothing in the name of the UNK and the name of the UNK and the name of the United States , to be able to say , " You know , to be able to take care of the money , but for the name of the UNK police police , it 's going to be the name of the UNK and the name of the United States ? "
I wanted to know that what was happening in Afghanistan in my opinion was about the state of conflict .
The war and the UNK of UNK made this sort of a UNK environment that I could do with my UNK UNK in the UNK of the UNK and UNK UNK in the UNK of UNK of the UNK and UNK UNK in the West .
And I also wanted to put a very simple UNK and a UNK UNK named UNK to see in the wall and talk about how modern art is to save the white skin from the UNK of the UNK of a UNK , and even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the UNK , even the UNK of the white skin of the white skin , even the UNK of the
But you may be able to get into prison if you may .
But one of the things I had to do was I had to do with my identity .
And that 's what I do . What are you ?
Thank you .
Hi , I 'm a UNK , and I was a model for the last time .
Now , 10 years .
Now , I had a UNK in this room , because I didn 't wear this dress .
Thank you for a second .
This is the first UNK in TED UNK , so I think it 's very lucky now .
And if there was a lot of a woman who was scared , I had no fear that I had to say , but I was going on the list of the Twitter .
And I also wanted to tell you that I was lucky enough to change my image in 10 seconds .
It 's not all people .
And it 's a very comfortable dance , and good news is I 'm not going to wear them .
The worst news is I 'm going to get this UNK from the head , because at this point you 're laughing , and when you get me wrong , I 'm not going to do that .
Yes , there you go .
So , why did I do this ?
That 's odd .
Don 't get a strange message like this .
It 's powerful , but it 's also UNK .
I 've changed my image in six seconds .
In fact , I was in real life in the real world .
When the photographer gave me a UNK , I was very grateful to see that guy 's hair .
And the thing is , to be two days ago with a surgery or two days ago , we can 't change the way that our appearance is , although it 's a UNK , it 's a UNK . It 's very large .
So today , for me , it 's not like I think it will be honest .
I 'm here today because I 'm a model .
And I was on this stage because I was a beautiful UNK woman called UNK .
And I wanted to answer that question often often ask me to be honest with a very honest approach .
The first question is , how do you get a model ?
And I always say , " I was discovered , but that 's what it was .
And my real reason for this is that I 've got the UNK genome , and I 'm a UNK , and you may be in wonder about where you are .
Well , in the last few centuries of what we define in the last century , not only about health , young and UNK , all of the things that we live with , UNK and UNK , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin .
This is my legacy , and this is what I 've been talking about .
And I know that some of you may probably have a UNK UNK , for instance , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK and UNK .
First of all , I 'm going to tell you how often you know about innovation .
But unfortunately , I 've got to tell you , in the last year in 2007 , at last year in 2007 , there were a few UNK of UNK in 2007 : UNK UNK in 2007 , which is not only about four or four , is not white .
The next time I was asked my question was , " Where did I get there ? "
And my first answer was , " I don 't know , because they didn 't let me sell it . "
But the second answer was , " Why ? " Why ? "
You know ? You can choose anything .
You can be the president of the United States or the UNK of the Internet , or a UNK poet , because you 'll be the first one .
And if , listen to those they weren 't saying , " No , no , I think , as a model , " I would say , " When my boss , " I would say , " When my boss ? "
Because I can 't decide anything that you can be the president of America or UNK or UNK UNK .
And you get a UNK when you grow a model , like a model like you , when you grow .
There 's nothing to do with your control . And when it 's good , it 's not a business industry .
And I 'm going to show you a little bit of a few years from my model , because it 's not just like a UNK .
So if they 're going to be the lights in here -- as beautiful UNK , I would like to take a look at the UNK of a walk , and then then , on the side of a walk , then , then , back in front of the next hand and then , then , back in front of your hand , you know , 300 and a half , and then , back in front of your hand , two and a half minutes , and then , back in front of your hand , two and a half is going to take a look at the front of the next five and a half minutes , and then , back in front of your hand , two and a half is going to go in front of your UNK , say , 400 , eight times .
This looks like this .
Don 't want to be a look like that .
I don 't know how it works .
And the reality is that when you get a UNK , you 've done a couple of jobs , you can 't do this , and if you say you want to be the president of America , then you write about what you say to be the president of America , when you say to be the president of America , when you say to be a president , you 'll be listening to see what you 're talking about .
The next question is , " Are they UNK ? "
Yes , they 'll grow all of you , but there 's a small part of the job .
This is my first prototype model , which is the first time I was wearing my UNK in my UNK .
I know it 's a private , but I was young .
This is a photograph that I photographed with my grandmother .
This is a picture taken from me .
And my friend came with me .
This is a picture I made my French UNK in France .
This is a photograph from my UNK magazine .
This is me .
And I hope you all know that these are no pictures of myself .
And it was made by a group of people who had a group of UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , who made them out of these images , rather than me .
And the next question is , " Can you get something free ? "
And I 've had a lot of time to be eight inches high , but for free , it 's what I want to talk about .
And I grew up in my UNK , and I walked into a shop shop , and they forgot to me a dress .
And as soon as I was driving my friend , I had to drive a bad driver , and I had to say , " I 'm just saying , " I 'm going to sleep on my head . "
And I got these because I was a UNK that was not my identity , and some of them had a price for it .
When I was in New York , last year , there were UNK UNK in New York City , where black men were black and white men , most young boys .
And in New York , for the young man and the UNK and the UNK , it was like they were , " Are I going to be there ? "
" I 'm going to stop . I 'll stop ? "
And what I found when I was doing this talk about this study in the United States is 13 in the United States of UNK in the United States of UNK in the United States of UNK in the last 13 .
So what 's the last question is , is , what is the last model ? "
And I guess the answer that they may expect is to be a UNK , and your hair has a UNK , you 're happy , you 're happy , it 's amazing . "
And then when we do that , we 'll give a question that 's like this .
And we said , " There 's a passion for creativity and passion and UNK and UNK . "
And it 's true , but it 's part of the fact , because we 're never going to be going to say , " I don 't say , " I 'm not secure . "
Because I had to worry what I was looking for a day .
And if you 've ever thought about if my leg is bigger than my leg , my hair is better , I 'll be happier ?
You just go back to the model , because they 've got the UNK leg , the most beautiful hair , and they may be the least one of the world 's UNK in the world .
So when I 'm going to do it for a talk , it 's very clear to find a sense of balance , because one of the things that if I stand here , I said , " Well , I can be grateful if it 's got to be grateful if it doesn 't really be comfortable . "
But the most difficult part is to see gender and passion in my life , because I had my own UNK .
But at the same time , I was happy with respect with respect to my youth , not just to work for 10 or 30 or a half years of UNK , because it was possible that I was not talking about how I was going to be doing this job how I was going to be doing my first job and how I was going to be doing what I was doing , and how I was going to be doing this for how I was going to be able to work for college or 30 years or how it might be possible .
And if this talk about this talk to you , I hope that we can 't see the success of what we are going on and what we can understand .
Thank you .
I 'm just going to ask a story today .
Don 't say I 'm normal .
And I wanted to tell you two brothers .
The UNK is 22 and a half years old year .
And he 's not speaking , but you can tell the story with a UNK , the best UNK in the house .
There 's a love to say , love .
He had nothing to share his love .
And he 's not UNK . He doesn 't want to be color .
He had no difference between religion , and he never said no words .
And when he was singing his childhood UNK , one of my childhood UNK , he reminded me what I was talking about in my life , and it was so fascinating .
The UNK is 16 years old and then UNK .
He had a UNK memory .
But it 's got sex .
And he didn 't remember if my chocolate was good , but remember I was going to see my UNK in my iPod , when he was four years old , our conversation was on the front of my chest , and my talk is the UNK birthday of UNK UNK .
Sounds amazing ?
But a lot of people don 't believe it .
And the fact is that it 's because they don 't have the UNK of the human being , it 's often UNK .
But one of the reasons that make me believe even though it 's not just as important as human beings , is that it 's an extraordinary thing that they 're extraordinary , but it 's extraordinary .
Some of you may not know the word " UNK , " it 's a complex brain disorder disorder , and it 's a complicated disorder , but it 's a UNK disorder .
Every one of the cases is special because it 's different from UNK .
In the last 20 minutes , there was a new UNK evidence that was one of the most UNK diseases in the world , but we didn 't know the reason why it was .
And the first time I had to say , " You know , " the word " is " I " or " I have " I do " UNK . "
When I was three years old , my brother was born , and I got a new family .
And after a few months I realized he was different .
And he was screaming .
And he didn 't want to be like the other baby , but in fact , he doesn 't seem to be me .
In his own world , using his own rule , he 's looking for a little bit like a small object in a small way , like the UNK in the back of a small thing , like the UNK of the box , he 's wearing the wheel in the box of his box with the machine .
And when he grew up , he 's got a lot more unique , and it 's even more obvious .
And there was something in the UNK ' UNK and UNK and UNK UNK , and one of the special things that he was looking at is his UNK , UNK UNK in the UNK , he was a man who never sat .
It 's too simple .
And I had no idea that I had a very difficult time when I wanted to be the same .
But then I turned back to them that I wanted to teach myself about my personality and communication and love that I realized that I was not willing to change " normal " or " normal . "
The normal difference is the UNK between differences between differences between differences .
It 's just a different species .
And I just wanted to say that a word for UNK is that you don 't have to be somebody who doesn 't want to be .
You can be extraordinary .
Whether or one of the differences between us -- we all have to be honest with each individual and to say , " normal " is exactly the potential of the human mind .
And the real and the possibilities of progress and progress and of change is that we think it 's very different from other people .
Don 't say I 'm normal . "
Thank you .
Dr. UNK , Dr. UNK , UNK UNK , UNK our UNK and curiosity , has only about two seconds in the last time .
But now , 50 years later , we can get a million million times a million times a year , or a UNK seconds , or a UNK seconds , or two or a half seconds in a UNK second .
Now I 'm going to show you an example of one of these things called UNK UNK , which is a technology that has a technology so fast that it can capture light .
So with this technology , we can be able to see the camera in a UNK that can see what we see in our bodies , and how these camera challenges are the definition of how our bodies are defined in our pockets .
Now , if I used a laser pen , and then on a UNK in a second -- a few seconds ago , I would build a UNK , which would be a few hundred and a half million times faster than the crash .
Now , what if you take this bullet and these UNK in this bottle , where will break the amount of water ?
What would be going on in the slow track ?
Now , the whole thing .
Now , please remember that this whole thing is actually going to be in a UNK -- it 's a video like that -- but now I 'll take this video down a million times faster than you can see .
But Coke 's going to fund this experiment .
Now , there are many things going on here , so let me show you a little bit .
Now , when it 's going to go into a bottle , then it 's a bullet that goes through the bottle , and then on the inside .
Some of these light hits the table , so you start to see the waves .
A lot of them are going to fall down the UNK and UNK them down .
And you can see , there 's a UNK bubble in the back there .
And at the same time , the waves go into the table , because you can see in the bottom of the glass , as you can see in the bottom of a bottle , a UNK hit .
Now , if you take a look at the same road with a normal crash , slow and slow video , then a million times a million times you know , you need to see how long it takes to see the whole process ?
And one week ? In fact , it 's a year .
And it 's really boring . It 's slow . It 's going to be a UNK .
But what about a few UNK ?
You can also see the waves in the table with a UNK and a wall .
This is like a rock in the water .
And I thought , this is how nature works , when it 's going to be a UNK , but of course , what we see in the eye is the part of the whole spectrum .
But if you 're looking at a coral , you 'll notice , when the light is UNK , it 's UNK . It 's not UNK . It 's not UNK .
Why ? Because the UNK , and the light in a UNK , UNK out of a UNK .
So in the future , when it flew in your cell phone , you can go to the supermarket , you can go out and be able to see if the fruit is going to come .
So , what did I do to make this camera in MIT ?
Now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to give you a short step , you just have a little bit of light , but we need a million times more than just a short time , but we need a million times faster than a short time .
So what we 've done is , we take them all the time , and then there 's a couple of times a lot of time , and then there 's a whole lot of UNK in the data , and then we say , " UNK , " which is what you 've seen before .
And we take all of these data into the UNK , and we 're doing a lot of fun .
Now , smoke fly .
Some of the other heroes can be invisible , but imagine a race -- he 's going to see a UNK in the back of the corner .
And that 's how we can do some light into the door .
And these light will go into the room and some of them go back to the camera and then then we can use these light .
That 's not what we do . We really do it .
On the left you see our UNK UNK camera .
There 's a UNK model in the wall , and we 'll get rid of it .
So , in our paper published about " Nature , " it was suggested that it was defined by nature of nature , and then they created this animation .
And what we 're going to do is we 're going to have to do that , and then we 're going to UNK the wall so that this light will fall down the direction of the direction , and then there 's going to be going to be going to go back and find a little bit of a light , and a little bit of a light will go back to the camera , but the thing is that it 's going to go back to the camera , but the most interesting thing is to go back to the camera , but the most interesting thing is to go back to the camera , but the most interesting thing is to go back to the camera , but the most interesting thing is to go back to the camera , but the most interesting thing is to go back and down .
And because we have a UNK camera , then as we flew over , we flew a camera , and this camera has something very different .
It 's a good time for time , and can detect the world in the speed of light .
So we have not only know the distance from the camera , but we don 't know where it 's going to be .
And as we can see , in this case , you can see in a very primitive image , like a very simple thing , but then we 'll take a lot of pictures , but we 'll take a lot of pictures , but then we 'll take a lot of pictures , and then we 'll take a little bit of a bunch of objects , and then we 'll take a lot of pictures of it , and then we 'll take a little bit of a lot of a different objects , and then we 'll take a lot of pictures of it , and then we 'll take a lot of pictures , and then we 'll take a little bit of a bunch of objects , and then we 'll take a lot of pictures of it , and then we 'll see a little bit of a UNK object , and then we 'll take a lot of pictures of it , and then we 'll take a lot of pictures , and then we 'll take a little bit of a lot of a difference , and then we 'll take a
Can we be a UNK ?
This is our model of our models .
And now we 're going to get some of these UNK in my life , but in the future , we can get this technology into a car so that you can see in the window , because we can see the UNK in the window , or we can be able to look at the heart , because we can see in the window in the window , or we can be able to look at the heart , so we can go back into the heart of a window , and we can be able to see the heart in the window , so we can go back to the outside of the body , and we can be able to look at the heart , so we can go back into the heart of a window , and we can be able to look at the heart of the body , so we can go back into the heart of a window , and we can be able to look at the heart of the body , so we can go back into the heart of a window , and we can be able to look at
But of course , because all kinds of tissues and blood vessels , that 's really difficult , so we call it a new model of scientists to fly a new model of health problems in the next generation of health care .
Now , a scientist , a scientist , a scientist , a science of art , a technology , a UNK art , and then I realized that we collect a lot of information in the same amount of information that we collect , and that 's a new example of how we get from a UNK display , which is that we 're looking for a whole range of time , and that 's the kind of thing that 's going on in the last two seconds .
But something interesting is happening .
And when you see the gravitational waves , they 're moving away from us .
But these waves should move forward to us .
What happened ?
And the result is , because we 're looking at the speed of light , we 've got a strange phenomenon , and Einstein will be looking at this .
And on the basis of the event , sometimes as fast as possible , as quickly as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible , we can be able to do that .
So whether it 's a site that 's going to be looking at the next generation and the next generation , it 's going to be more UNK , we 've had all of the data and all the details that we 've done , and that we are , of course , the UNK , the whole study of the study , and we hope that we should be in a different kind of UNK , and we hope that we should be working on a UNK UNK in the other way that we should do it .
Time is . Thank you .
This is the place where I live in Kenya , Kenya , in the UNK National Park .
And in my bedroom was my father in the cow , right here in the cow .
There 's nothing in the south of the UNK of UNK Park , which means that the wild animal can be free in the park .
So it 's the predator that will follow them , and that 's what they do .
They killed our UNK .
And this is one of the things I had killed in the night when I woke up in my morning and it was dead , because it was the only thing I had in my house .
We believe that we believe that we 've got our animals and family from heaven to come from heaven and UNK , and that 's why we do that .
So I grew up with lions .
And one of the men , they 're the UNK ; they protect our families and our livestock , but they were so frustrated that they were frustrated like this .
So they decided to kill these lions .
This is one of the six lions that they killed in the UNK National Park .
And I think it 's a very bad reason for the UNK Park .
In our family , there was six to nine years old and they had to have their father 's rights , and then there was something else happened to me .
So I had to find a solution .
The first method I thought I wanted to use fire , because I know that lions are scared .
But then I realized that this didn 't work well , and it helped to see our UNK back .
But I didn 't give up . I was UNK .
And then there was a second solution : UNK UNK .
And I wanted to leave the lion and make them look for me as I was standing in front of me .
But lions are smart .
And the first day they saw UNK , then went back , and then , the next day , they 'll come back and say , " I 've never been able to do it , but he 's still there . " And he 's still there .
So they dance , and killed animals .
And one night , I took a UNK in my UNK , and that night , that night , there was no .
And I started to realize that lions would fear the light light .
So I had a idea .
And because I was a kid , I could never do this every day in my house , and I would kill my mom and my mom , even before I had killed my mom , and I even killed a lot of the time I was going to die about .
So I found a UNK UNK , a UNK , which is a small device from a UNK in a UNK , so you can turn the lights off .
And at the same time , I found a switch , a light bulb to control light .
The light bulb comes from a bad UNK .
Everything was ready .
As you can see , as you can see , it 's going to be UNK by solar cells to produce a battery , and then I 'll give it to the battery , and that 's what I call the energy call , " The UNK . "
And that would be the result , again , to be able to light the light up .
As you can see , this light is UNK , because the lions are coming from here .
And that 's what it looks like when the UNK is closer .
And the light bulb was going to ignore lions , they thought , I was walking around UNK , but in fact , I was working on my bed in my bed and I was doing a lot of UNK in my bed .
Thank you .
And then I took this device in two years ago , and since then I was there , and we weren 't back up with the UNK UNK of UNK .
And my neighbors , they all heard about this .
One of them was this grandmother .
There 's a whole bunch of UNK in the house , and she asked me if I could help her in my house .
And I was sure .
And then I had these lights , and you can see in the back there , these are the UNK UNK .
And so far , I 've had the UNK of seven families in our family , and they 're very useful light .
Now , my approach has been to be surrounded by the UNK of Kenya , like the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the same as well as the UNK , the same as the UNK , the same as the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK .
And I was fortunate enough to get a UNK , and this is the best school in Kenya -- I was so excited about this .
And my new school today , and I also joined it , and then help me get more and more money .
And I even brought back to my family , and help them in my house , and I teach them how to do that .
And a year ago , I was just a tropical UNK in the UNK ' UNK UNK of my UNK , and I was often looking for a plane in a plane and told myself what was going on .
Today , I did .
And I got a UNK . This is the first time I got it .
So my great dream is , when I grew up , I became a UNK engineer .
And I hate lions , but now it 's because my invention saved my dad and UNK , and we finally have lions .
Thank you very much .
You don 't believe . You know what you 're going to hear you like this story .
So you 've got this . Richard UNK : Yes .
You 're not looking for a computer ?
What 's the next step for you ?
And my next project was , I wanted to do a electricity station : " The UNK ? "
UNK UNK : I know , the electricity is already there , but I just wanted to be one of my own .
You 've tried a time , right , but you say , " I 've never tried this before , but I stopped . I 'm not going to stop , because it 's going to be me .
It 's a UNK . Richard , you 're different .
We 're going to walk through every step in growth , friends , friends .
Thank you very much . Thanks . Thanks .
I lived in Los Angeles in Los Angeles .
This is Los Angeles : UNK , UNK , UNK land .
And so the UNK of the city , talking about Los Angeles , is going to talk about Los Angeles what it means to be in Los Angeles , so it 's going to be the center of the city in Los Angeles , like that it 's going to solve the city of the city in the city .
This is the South Los Angeles .
The hotel , the UNK , the UNK , the land .
And at the same time with other UNK , my life , my life in food , in UNK , is going to be UNK .
And the interesting thing is to get killed by killing more .
In L.A. UNK , people died about UNK diseases .
And for instance , one of the things I live in my neighborhood is about five times higher than the UNK UNK UNK , which is eight times higher than eight times .
And I was tired of this .
And at the same time I was thinking , what if you had to get healthy food , you feel , what if you walk from your home and see the food system of food systems in your community 's food system , what are you ?
And I saw a lot like a UNK car .
And I saw UNK in a UNK way .
I don 't think that 's going .
And I think the answer lies inside .
The food is the problem , the food is the solution .
And then I was tired of 45 minutes to get married to dinner with a UNK .
So what I did was , I was working on my house with a food farm in my house .
It 's the UNK in which we call the park .
150 to 150 feet long .
UNK government is there .
But there 's a way to maintain it .
So I thought , " Great ! This is my responsibility , I have to maintain it , so I think what can be done ! "
This is why I maintain it .
So my team and my team , " L.A. UNK , we get together working together to grow their food forests , the UNK , the nine vegetables .
We 're a free organization that 's UNK UNK in different cities , and everyone is all volunteers and all of the things that we do .
The garden is beautiful .
But it 's pretty fast .
And the government came to me and told me that I had to get rid of my garden , and I wanted to get my garden back to a UNK .
And I thought , " What 's going on ?
Is it possible that no matter of food on a small land ?
And then I thought , " Yes , come like this . "
Because it doesn 't happen .
And so the Los Angeles had written a story about the story of the story of the story and the UNK and a UNK UNK , and they UNK it up to UNK , and we succeeded .
We get successful from our hands .
And they even came back to visit and saw how they love and love what we do .
And I mean , of course , how can they do that ?
The UNK in Los Angeles is in the United States .
It had the UNK of UNK .
It was about 20 Central Park .
And there 's plenty of spaces that are growing in UNK .
And why is they so bad ?
A tree can get a thousand or a thousand seeds .
A dollar UNK can bring 75 dollars for you .
This is my mantra , I told people , to grow up with your food .
UNK food is like yourself .
And then , in Los Angeles I had a competition .
And I grew up there , and I hired my son .
And I refused to be part of something that I could create , and that I wanted myself to create my own reality .
You see , I 'm a artist .
UNK is my assistant , and I created art .
It was like a UNK artist , where they were UNK , and then I was , UNK , UNK , UNK .
And I used the garden and the land as a canvas , and the plant and the trees were the UNK in my canvas .
You may be surprised by what the earth can do if you put it into your canvas .
You can 't imagine how amazing this is , but it 'll be able to make a difference .
What happened ?
And I saw my garden into education , and became the source of my community .
And to change the community , you have to change the part of the soil .
We are soil .
You will be shocked by how children work .
It 's the most good thing about the physical and the UNK activity , especially in the middle of the UNK .
And then you can get UNK .
And I remember one of my mom and daughters were in my UNK when I saw them , when I saw them , they had a lot .
And they made me very bad . I told them , you don 't have to do things like that .
This is the reason for the street in the street .
And when I saw my UNK from my UNK , it made me feel guilty , and that led to me , and people ask me , " Well , why don 't you , " Are you going to sell you food ? "
And I said , " Of course , I mean , I hate it .
And that 's why it 's in the streets .
That 's what I wanted .
I wanted people to take it , but at the same time , I wanted people to get healthy . "
And then one of the things that happened when I was in the center of a UNK in Jerusalem was a garden .
And these guys helped me UNK .
And that 's cool , they 're sharing stories about how it 's going on how they produce and how they work their mothers , and how they grow their mothers and how they do it , just for that moment .
The green idea of the green thing , maybe 20 garden .
We 've got about 50 million people involved in our team , and they are all volunteers .
And if the kids grow their UNK , the kids will eat UNK .
And if they grow it up , they will eat .
But when these guys don 't see the kids in their kids , if they don 't see how food food works , they 're going to eat the food in front of the food in front of them .
And I saw young people who wanted to work , but they were willing to spend time in that time , and then I saw a lot of colors , and then I saw each other colors , and then there was no UNK in the other way .
And as I found a computer activity , I found a chance that we could train these kids to take their communities and UNK their communities .
When we do that , who knows ?
The next name of George Washington , Washington .
But if we don 't change the surface of the soil , we 'll never do this .
This led me to one of these projects . This is what I wanted to do .
And I wanted to get a house in this neighborhood where people can share food .
And I wanted to UNK it into a healthy restaurant .
Don 't get me wrong .
And I didn 't want to be free , because free is not sustainable .
And the cool thing about sustainability is that you have to keep it .
And what I 'm talking about is that it 's time for people to get their kids moving away from the streets , to know that they grow food and UNK and UNK and UNK .
And so what I wanted to do was to figure out what was going to be .
I wanted to be part of the environmental revolution , the UNK , the UNK .
We 're going to UNK the golden definition .
And if you 're not a UNK , you 're not a UNK .
When you get a UNK ?
Make it a weapon to be the weapon of your choice .
And basically , if you want to see me , if you want to meet , if you want to sit in a UNK chair , I call them .
And if you want to see me , take a garden with a garden , then we can be a little bit .
And that 's what it 's like . Thank you .
Thank you .
And in 2011 , on December of July , I was a photographer and UNK in New York City .
We 're UNK and UNK .
And we 're always going to be in the middle of a UNK , and the studio doesn 't have the UNK , the main thing is to defend the sun .
And we 're going to be able to get better models like this , and we can get the perfect UNK , but we have the media , but we 're a very proud artist and a UNK , understanding images and pictures of images and pictures .
And on July 11th , in March , I saw a tragedy in Japan in Japan in Japan .
And after soon after I went out to be a group of volunteers , a group of volunteers , a team of volunteers , who was working on the team , just three days later on one side of the UNK in the local 60s .
And I and I have been working with other volunteers : We can 't wait for home , so I decided to join them , and I decided to get three weeks out of school .
I was in Japan in Japan , UNK UNK in Japan .
And that is the size of Japan in Japan , which is about 50,000 people , is the first place where the UNK was .
On the peak of the peak of the peak of the UNK UNK , there are two and a half from the UNK of the UNK .
You can imagine , this is a UNK UNK .
We had UNK in the UNK of UNK and UNK .
We can help schools and clean houses , clean and UNK .
We clean up a lot of UNK , UNK , UNK , white fish .
We 've become UNK and UNK , but we are UNK .
And just a few weeks , all the volunteers and the local UNK had found something like this .
And they then found a photograph , UNK , camera and UNK .
And that 's what everybody 's going to do with action .
And then they took these pictures and they collect them , and they send them back to the side of the tree .
And now , as I realized it , I had lost these pictures , and this was a very big part of my loss .
When they had a tsunami attack , they had to be UNK , UNK , UNK , all of all the things that happened .
And my last day in Japan in Japan , I found myself on a UNK center in Japan .
And then help a huge UNK in a UNK .
And it happened to be the local UNK center where people lost .
And when they took a picture of it , I was very lucky to get the trust , let me get some trust and UNK them .
And those moments of all things , as well as it was , I was listening to people who said , " Well , when I clean this picture , I really do this stuff . "
And when I go to see these pictures , there 's a UNK period of time , and some of them are UNK in the UNK of the UNK , maybe I can get people from one of the UNK of a UNK UNK , or maybe I know a lot of people who can help them go back and find their pictures back to me .
And so , after day , I came home from the side of a Facebook team who had a lot of UNK , and said they wanted to help me , I know that we should do it .
And so we started building a map .
This is a picture that was tried .
And it 's not a big deal , but it 's got a fish in the water where it 's got a little bit of a UNK face , and we have to be able to repair it , and we can be accurate accurate .
Otherwise , it 's not going to look like a baby 's face -- it 's a bad thing -- it 's a tragedy , it 's a very tragic picture .
And over time , more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more , we need to get more and more excited about it , and then I 'll go back and work on Facebook and UNK and UNK UNK , and then I 'll go to the UNK and UNK site that I wanted to help , and then two of them will be willing to help me , to get out of five different countries .
Two weeks , I had 150 volunteers , and they were willing to join us .
And so on in Japan , just in Japan , we set up a bunch of UNK UNK UNK in the UNK , UNK UNK in Japan .
Every week , we 've got a UNK device that people came back to their UNK UNK .
And sometimes , some of the older women never saw the scanner , but they found themselves in a very long time , and then they would be able to get two and a half minutes , or so they would be able to get a look at the other side of the planet , and then they would be turned into the other side of the planet , and then they would be UNK in the other side of the planet , and then they would be UNK in the other side of the planet , and then they would be UNK in the other side of the planet , and then they would be UNK in the other side of the planet , and then they would be UNK in the other side of the planet , and then they would be UNK in the other side of the planet , and then they would be UNK in the other side of the planet , and then they would be UNK in the other side of the planet , and then they would be UNK in the other side of the planet , and then they would be
And yet , at the time , they had to get back to those pictures as much as possible as possible , and , of course , it depends .
And maybe a half a week can fix it , maybe a few weeks .
It 's even a few months later .
And the beautiful part of the photos had to be UNK by hand , or to the UNK , to the UNK , to UNK the objects that didn 't fit in the water .
The entire process is very busy .
And all of these pictures , UNK , UNK , UNK in the trash , sometimes UNK in the trash , sometimes UNK in the trash , sometimes the whole thing is going on in the trash , so it 's a big part of the whole thing that 's going on in the trash , so it 's a big part of the whole big part of the project .
And if those are not going to be clean clean , we can 't do it again , to fix it , they still have to dry , they still have to dry up .
It was very well during what we do .
There was a woman who UNK us up .
It 's easy for these pictures .
As my UNK UNK , he said , it 's like a UNK .
You can 't have any UNK , UNK results .
And that 's a very lucky woman named us all these pictures .
And she started making her hand , until she realized she had a little bit of damage to her body .
Okay , there 's a UNK in her picture .
Otherwise , in the picture , she had no control with her facial faces , and we made all of these parts of all of a good images , and then I was able to make this photograph .
And when she came here , she shared a few photos from each other picture .
And what she found out of her UNK in her husband was discovered that there was a lot of UNK in the local UNK house , where they were recognized him .
At the end of the tsunami , he 's responsible for making sure that the tsunami is closed into the sky .
And as a result , he had to go down to the tsunami .
And then there 's two sons , although I can 't see a few different schools in two different schools .
And one of the kids working on the tsunami .
And then she spent a few weeks to get back to his family , and they were UNK .
And then we gave her the day that she was going to be 14 years old .
And to her , although the UNK of UNK and UNK , those pictures were given to his son 's best gift , which is that there 's nothing in the story of his son , when he lives three months of his life , is that it 's destroyed .
And in Japan , six months later , " UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK , hundreds of UNK , and most of all of them , for example , is far more than four or four .
And most of those were finally going back to the UNK , which is a very important one .
More than 500 volunteers worked together hundreds of thousands of photos of their families , all of these pictures .
In this period , we didn 't have 10,000 dollars for a device or material for a device or a material .
We 're going to get pictures .
A photograph is a remind and a UNK , and to remind us some of us , some of them , a UNK , a UNK .
They help us record and UNK and our past , but sometimes the human mind is often what we do , but sometimes the first thing I wanted back back was my first time to go back .
And that 's the whole project , for the UNK of the human mind , to UNK the UNK of the past .
And when there 's a picture of this picture , it 's going to be a big difference between UNK life .
And that 's a lot of work for us .
And for a few images , the experience came up with a link between them , connecting to something bigger than the UNK of an UNK , UNK man .
And I wanted to read that email for a minute , and then I received a letter from UNK , which is six months back when I was walking back in Japan .
" When I was on the UNK , I wanted to get all of the stories and the pictures of both of them .
And one of them is just a photograph of UNK and a young woman , a little girl , a little girl , a little girl in my house , and my grandmother , my grandmother , and then , as I was born in my house , my grandmother , sitting on my wall in my house .
There are UNK in the world , beyond the age of the population , and we 've got some of the most fundamental needs in the world , right ? "
Thank you very much .
And today , I want to talk to you about a UNK problem , the answer to this question .
And I 'm going to be the secret of the women , and the question I 'm going to answer is , " Why are I going to get rid of violence ? "
" How would you be willing to live with a man with a UNK ? "
And I 'm not a doctor , a social and a community of UNK .
I 'm just one of the women I want to tell you about .
I was 22 years old and graduated from Harvard .
And I moved to New York , and I started my first job at the first job at UNK in UNK and UNK .
And the first time I had my house , I had the first credit card . And I had a very big secret .
And the secret is that I was told to be my favorite man who used to be a UNK on my soul , too much time .
And one of my favorite people , with a gun , is to kill me , and to kill me , I 've heard how many times I do .
Now the story that I 'm talking about with this story of " crazy love " is a UNK of UNK , and even some of the men will fall into this .
Perhaps it 's happening in your body .
I don 't look like a typical family victim .
And I had the director of Harvard College in the State of Harvard , and there was a UNK in the market where there was a team in the UNK of UNK .
And I think that most of the time I work for is the UNK company , UNK , UNK and Washington .
And then my second dog husband was about 20 years and then three kids .
And I had a black , UNK , UNK UNK in UNK .
And that 's what I 'm going to tell you about : Finland can happen in every case of your race , religious and education .
It 's everywhere .
And the second thing I want to talk about is that many of you think of women as women in women , that should be the issue of women .
No .
More than 70 percent of them are men , and they 're UNK , they 're UNK , they 're UNK , it 's the least we don 't want to see in violence , and that 's one of the reasons why the women in violence are not aware of it .
And I thought that there was only one of us who would continue to stay in a UNK like this , but in fact , it was very popular in my age .
And I was 22 years old , and at least in the United States , 16 and older women were killed by the women who had died in the United States and had killed more than two women , or girls in the United States , or girls in the United States , or a woman or a girl .
And I was a very typical victim , because I had nothing to do with a change in which I was violent and UNK .
And I met UNK in a UNK , and then at the end of the summer , it was cold and it was cold .
We had to sit in New York City , and he came to me with me .
He told me two things .
And the first is he graduated school at UNK , and working on a good Wall Street .
But one of the first things that happened to me leave me was to leave my mind with love and humor , to look at a farm like a farm .
And his eyes were like a UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK .
And one of the smartest things that happened to be done in the first place was that I believe in this respect that I was a UNK .
And as soon as I was , he had me thought that I was a UNK .
And we started talking , and he liked all of the things that I was in Harvard , my passion , my job , my UNK , my job , my job , my job .
He wanted to know my family , my childhood , my wish .
And Dr. King was one of those women , I was in a woman with a woman and a man who never had ever experienced it .
And he told me that he had a secret to tell him , he told me , he told me that he was working in the UNK when he was four years old , and he told me that he had been working in the UNK when he was four years old , he had to do it as well as if I was four years old , and he spent a lot of UNK in the UNK of his UNK when he died , and he spent a lot of time on his third grade , and he spent a lot of time on his third grade , and he 'd spent a lot of time on his third grade .
And that 's why UNK 's degree , the city of Wall Street , the UNK of the Wall Street , for him .
And if there was a man who said to me , " my love and my God and my friends and I love , that my name has a UNK , my wife , my house , I would love you , because I can 't see a bad way or a UNK or a anger .
And then I didn 't know what was going to be the UNK and the UNK .
And I didn 't know , the second step to be isolated .
And not to come back home and say to me later , " Hey , " I 'll go in the middle of my house , but I want to get you to your family , and I 'll leave you with your house , and I 'll leave you all the way you leave your apartment and your friends and your friends , and then I 'll leave you all the way that your friends and your friends and your friends ' UNK are going to see you , and I 'll leave you with your UNK and your friends and your friends , and then I 'll leave you all the way that your friends and your friends and your friends ' UNK are going to see you , and I 'll leave you with your UNK and your friends and your friends , and then I 'll leave you all the way that your friends and your friends and your friends will be able to see yours in your neighborhood . "
And the fact is , when he came to school at a Friday night and told me he had quit his job , he wanted to get his job , he told him , he had to say , but he wanted to leave his office , and he just wanted to go to the city , and he just wanted to get out of the city , and he wanted to leave his new life , and he wanted to get the New York City , and he had to go to the city where he had to leave the New York .
And at the time , my favorite thing I had to leave in New York was to leave my love , but for my soul , I wanted to do my job , so I agreed , and then I agreed , I had to leave the house , and I had quit my job , I had to leave the house , and I had to leave in Manhattan .
And I thought that I had a crazy love , and I had no idea what I was walking into my life and the economy of my life and the economy .
And the third part of the violence is that it starts with violence .
And that 's what happened to me .
We just moved to New England -- I think it should be safe -- he bought three guns .
A pair of UNK in the car .
And one on the side of a bed is there , and the third one is going on in your pocket .
And he said that his childhood had to make sure he had to have these guns .
And let 's make it safe .
The gun had a clear signal for me , although he didn 't have a gun , even though I was told I was not in the edge of my life .
The first time was the first time in front of my wedding day .
And that 's the morning UNK , and I was wearing UNK .
And I was working on a computer job , and I wanted to get a computer job , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , and then I was a UNK on my neck , and I couldn 't breathe it , he had to go off my leg and put it in my leg .
Five days later , there was a UNK in my neck , and I was sitting on my mom 's UNK , and I was a UNK .
And even though it happened , I was sure that we could be happy life , because we were so proud .
And he had a deep UNK .
And he had a lot of stress , and a half of my wedding and my family members came up with a UNK .
It was a surprise , and he wouldn 't hurt me again .
And then I was then UNK for two times .
And the first time I had to find my UNK in front of the crash , he had to stop in the UNK of my head , and I had to stop on my desk , and I had to stop on my head , and I had so much the UNK that I had in my seat .
Not a few days , he had to go home and drive his way to drive home home , and he threw a cold UNK in my face .
And then two and a half years of my UNK , I 'll be doing two times a week ago .
And I used to say that I had this idea that I had this idea .
In fact , every three American woman , a goal of violence or a potential goal , and UNK report was called 15 million children per year and a half million .
So in fact , I 'm not here .
And back to my question , why did I get there ?
And the answer is simple .
I didn 't know him .
And although he had my head on my head , I was going to UNK my UNK , my dog , in my UNK , and I never thought of myself as a UNK wife .
And on the contrary , I was a very high woman who had a very high man who had a UNK man , and I was the only man who could help Dr. UNK on his heart .
And one of the questions I want to ask you is , is , why does she go out ?
Why did I stay ? I had a lot of opportunity .
And for me , it was the most powerful thing I had ever had ever had to be , but only the victims of our victims had to leave with what was going on .
Because the last part of violence is to kill her .
More than 70 percent of the women who died in the victims of the victim , when she left , it was going to be UNK .
And then there was something like a long-term track , and even UNK UNK , who had to do it with their children , who had to be victims of his mother and their parents , and that would be the man who was going to be UNK by the men who had their parents .
Now , we still ask , " Why would you not ? "
And as I decided to leave , it was the last time I had a UNK in my life .
And I realized that if I didn 't resist this man , he 'd kill me .
So I broke silence .
And I went to everybody : the police , my friends and family , who I was here , I could stand here , because everybody everyone helped me .
We tend to represent victims of UNK , UNK women , just like the UNK UNK of the news .
" Why is she going to leave her ? " Ask this question .
And it 's actually saying that , " it 's her UNK . It 's like the victim of a UNK and UNK UNK .
But UNK UNK , who was published after a book , a lot of men and women had told me what they wanted to do , and they had to start with a lot of their time , and they started working with their lives , and they started working in life -- my friends and my mother , as I was working as a man and my mother and my mother , as I was living as a man and my mother and my mother , as I was living as a man , my wife and my mother , as I was living as a man , my wife and my mother , as I was working as a man and my mother and my mother , as I was living as a man and my mother and my mother , as I was living as a man and my mother and my mother , as I was living as a man and my mother and my mother , as I was working as a man and my mother and my mother , as I was working as a man and my mother and my mother , as
In fact , I 'm a typical family victim , a classic family survivor .
And I had a UNK with a UNK man who had a good man and had three kids .
And I had a black , UNK , UNK UNK in UNK .
And I never had to be a dog , which would love to love my UNK in my body , to love my own head .
At this moment , you may be wondering , well , that 's amazing , it 's , " but it 's in my process , and in fact , I 'm talking about you .
And I can assure you , there are now some people who are listening to girls who suffer or be UNK or you 're a UNK .
UNK may be happening in your girls and your sisters , your best friends .
And I would end up with the story of love with crazy silence .
Today I still beat silence in silence .
This is the way I help other victims , as well as I ended up with you .
Tell people what you 're hearing today .
UNK only lives in silence .
You have the ability to stop ' families with no light .
We need people to help each other .
We need people to understand the secret of women .
You know , your kids , your friends and your friends , your friends and your friends , is UNK UNK .
And help suffer from UNK and UNK , UNK , UNK .
And there 's a UNK of violence that 's going on and out of the UNK and the way it 's going to be safe if it 's going to be safe to the victims of the victims .
And let 's say that , let 's get our bed , our UNK and family are the security and peace of them that they should be secure .
Thank you .
When I was a child , I think my country was the best one , and one of my big UNK was a song called UNK UNK .
And I think it 's very proud .
In school , we used a lot of time to learn about UNK history , but we 've never seen a lot about the planet in the outside , except to know that the United States and the Japanese and Japanese are the enemy .
And even though I 've been talking about the world today , I think that I spent my life in North Korea , until all of all things happened .
When I was seven , my first UNK UNK , but I thought I was normal in North Korea .
And my family and no poverty , and to me , I never experienced a hunger .
But in 1995 , my mom took a letter to get home from her sisters and sisters .
It says , " When you read this letter , there are five men in my house , because we 've eaten two weeks .
And now we 're lying on the floor , our bodies are hungry and ready . "
And I was shocked .
And that was the first time I had to live on my country .
And after that , as soon as I walked out of a train , I saw a very UNK thing that made me sick .
A dead woman is lying on the ground , and then there 's a UNK child , and the child 's got to UNK his face 's face .
But nobody helped them , because you can 't be different from yourself .
There was a severe famine in the UNK in the ' 90s .
And unfortunately , over a lot of a million people die of famine , and many of them are dependent on UNK , UNK and UNK .
And the power becomes increasingly , and the rest of the night I 've been UNK in my UNK , except the Chinese in China , in the river of the city , is to get through the river floor of the house .
And I often think about why they have a UNK and we don 't .
This is a satellite map taken from the UNK of the UNK and the UNK .
This is a part of China and North China .
As you can see , there 's a UNK in a place where there 's a very high place where there 's a fish that can take China to China .
But there are a lot of people who are going to die .
And sometimes I saw UNK .
And I can 't wait too many times when I left North Korea , but I was told that it was the most difficult year in the wild , and I was sent to China and a lot of living .
And then I thought that I was just a short time for my family .
But I had no idea that I had spent 14 years as I had my experience .
In China , I was a very young man with a little girl .
And I had no idea that , as a UNK , my future , I was very hard to realize that life had to be difficult , and even worse , because they were UNK in China in China .
So I was living in fear , and I was afraid of my identity , and I was told to Korea , I was going to go to North Korea , and I was arrested .
And one day , my worst UNK was true , and I was sent to the Chinese police and then the police police .
Some of you know , I 'm a UNK , so the police test my name , and I asked a lot of questions .
And as I was in my mind , my heart was going to wake up my mind .
And if there was no way , then I went to prison and went back .
And I thought I was finished in my life , but anyway , I was still trying to hide my fear and fear and answer their questions .
And then one of the police said to another man , " The report is wrong .
She 's not a UNK . "
And then they left me . It 's a miracle .
Some of them were able to find a lot of UNK in China , but a lot of people were killed by the Chinese and then killed the North .
These girls are lucky .
And even though they were caught , they were forced to UNK their stress and they were released .
But there are a few other bees who are lucky .
Hundreds of UNK in China are arrested at the end of China and then back to North Korea , where they were UNK or UNK or UNK .
And although I was lucky enough to get out of North Korea , I had a lot of UNK .
And this is a tragic fact , and that is the UNK , right now , to be able to survive .
And even though , they learned Chinese , they found their lives , they had UNK in their entire world .
And that 's why , after 10 years after 10 years , I decided to go to Korea , and then , then I started a new life in my life .
And they are much more difficult in Korea than I imagined .
English is too important in Korea , so I had to start studying three and English language -- English .
And also , I realized , had had huge differences between Korea and North Korea .
And even though we are UNK people , but we 've become very different from our bodies , because the UNK are UNK .
And I even experienced my identity .
Who I was in Korea , or Korea ?
Where did I come from ? Who was I ?
And all of a sudden , I can 't be proud of what I call a country .
And although it 's not a very good thing , it 's not the same thing , but I still decided it .
It 's ready to go to college .
And after I started UNK new lives , I got a UNK phone .
And then the government got rid of the money that I sent back to my left , as a punishment , my family had to be UNK , to move into a rural place .
They had to get rid of that , so I started planning for help .
North Carolina , the path of freedom , is exactly what it 's like .
If you think about the border between North Korea and North Korea , it 's impossible , so it 's what it is , I 'm sitting on the ground and then go into the border of China .
And because my family doesn 't understand Chinese , so I have to help them in China in China , through a UNK , in China .
We had a week on the bus for a week and a few times a week .
And once again , one of the buses that we 're sitting on is the UNK , a Chinese officer .
He looked at each other guy , and then they started UNK .
Because my family doesn 't understand Chinese , I fear that they will be caught .
So when the Chinese officer came back to my family , I would stand up to tell him that there was a couple of them , and I was the UNK .
And he was looking at me , but fortunately , he believed to me .
And so we get there all the way , but I 've got to get rid of all the UNK ' UNK ' UNK .
And even though we 've got this , my family still was illegal for illegal UNK .
And after I had a UNK and a UNK , my family had been released after a month , but before time , they were caught in the capital of UNK and UNK .
That 's one of the moments of my life .
And I had my family to get freedom , and then I was able to get this family on my family , and then I had a prison in the UNK of North Korea , and it wasn 't far away from North Carolina and then .
And when I was working with the police and the police and the police , there was a lot of work in my UNK that I was able to get rid of , but I had no money , or I had no enough money .
And I was UNK .
And then , I heard a man asked me , " How ? "
And I was a UNK . I had a complete stranger .
And I used to say that English in my English language , in my words , is to say , " There 's going to be a UNK for my family , and then there 's a UNK for my family , and then there 's the rest of the rest of the UNK and the next two and a half more than my family and his family . "
And I love him , and I said , " Why are you going to help me ? "
" I 'm not helping you , " he said .
" I 'm working for the people in North Korea . "
And then I realized that it was a UNK moment .
And that UNK stranger was the most hopeful thing about my and UNK , who made me understand that strangers and UNK and international societies are the ones that we need to eat .
And eventually , after a long trip , my family and I ended up in Korea , and then it was a free and a half war .
A lot of UNK and their families , and when they are in the new country , they usually have a lot of money or a few .
And so we can get education from the international society , to train and to train and help .
And we can also be able to communicate with the world as the UNK of the world , because there 's a lot of people who live in North Korea , where we go back to the information where the information is and the money is changing the water from North Korea .
And I was so fortunate that helped me , so I wanted to help people who dream in international aid , a dream of dream .
And I 'm sure you 'll see more about the UNK of UNK in the middle of the world , including TED .
Thank you .
You may agree with this path .
It 's the UNK ; it 's a very good material , and it 's good for a long time , but it 's not always like the weather , it 's the weather when it 's like today , the rain of rain .
It will be a UNK in the UNK .
And especially if you 're riding like a bicycle , you 're not good .
And at the same time , the UNK will produce a lot of noise .
And this material is a bit of a UNK , and if we 're going to build the same path , as the Netherlands is , we will hope a little bit of a little bit of a bit of noise .
The solution is to be used in a UNK .
The UNK is a little bit of a UNK in the Netherlands , and there 's a little bit of UNK in the middle of the UNK , where it 's going to be UNK , the wind will go from the road , and the cars do the same thing as well as the UNK in the road , as well as the UNK , as well as the UNK in the road .
It will disappear in those UNK .
And it 's got a lot of water , a UNK , so it 's quiet .
And , of course , it 's got to say , it 's UNK , it 's UNK .
What 's called UNK ? Look at this rock here in the UNK .
And then started a few , and more and more and more , and then I couldn 't demonstrate it .
But they 'll ignore the glass of a glass , and you 're sure you 're not happy .
And finally , these UNK UNK will bring back into a lot of damage .
And sometimes there will be something like that .
Ah , he was early .
The UNK , of course , is the UNK problem , but we have a solution .
And what you see here is that these materials have damage .
This is the UNK , as I said , the rock is a small UNK .
And because of the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK UNK , if it 's UNK , there will be a small UNK , and then there 's a little bit of UNK in the UNK , there will be a UNK .
And if you 're on this road , you 've got this UNK .
In order to do that , we think of ourselves as a UNK .
And if we can fix this material , there may be a solution .
And what we use is clean UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , which is the size of these small UNK .
So there are a few UNK in there right now .
You need a machine that 's like this , a UNK machine -- that can be cooking .
UNK motors can heat . It 's got a good job of heat steel .
So what we 're going to do is , we 've got all the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK get into the UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK in the UNK ,
And it was so big that you had a lot of motor motors , which I showed up here .
The UNK principle is similar to the UNK .
And then I put it inside , and this is what it 's going to see .
This is what it looks like today .
We 've got UNK in the lab in our lab .
And we 've tested several samples , and the government has seen our results , and they decided , " This is interesting , we should try . "
The government has given a UNK board for us to see the material in UNK meters , where we are doing a material testing .
And that 's what we do . You see a UNK set of things like this , and there 's a number of years that 's going to be good for a couple of years . And that 's what we do .
And we 've got a lot of data on this road in the lab .
And we 've done the UNK experiments , and we 've added a lot of UNK that we use to break them down and down and down and down and down .
And we can do that again .
In fact , one of the results of this experiment was that if we had to do this in this path -- we used to use our waste machine in this road , we had to get the power of the road , and we had to get a lot of that , and then there was a lot of money going on in the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and we had a lot of money going on the road , and
So the conclusion is that we 've made a material that we can use to make the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the amount of money that will be saved by the speed of the crash so that you 'll save the speed of the crash .
You wonder what you 're going to do .
And we can look at this . Now , a little hot .
In fact , what I 'm going to do is cut it down to you with a lot of control .
But try it .
See , yes , it works .
Thank you .
I wanted to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
There are 10,000 birds in the planet .
The UNK is the one of the most UNK species in their UNK .
And when you see UNK in your mind , it 's just a UNK , it 's a UNK , it 's a terrible creature , and it 's got a terrible creature to be able to help .
And I wanted to change this idea : I wanted to change these bad ideas about UNK , because they need to be compassionate . They really need it .
Let me tell you why .
First of all , why are they going to leave us all ?
And Charles Darwin had Charles Darwin in the UNK of the UNK of the UNK , he said , " These guys , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK ,
You 're going to find harder to find out what 's going on , but it 's Charles Darwin .
You know , Darwin 's time to go back in England , I 'll tell you why .
And UNK had been UNK -- UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK .
And recently , if you 've got the news news in Kenya -- it 's the irony that the president of the Gulf of Ireland -- but I think it 's true that it 's going to be the UNK of the UNK and the UNK . But I think it 's true .
I want to question it . You know why ?
Because Congress are not able to maintain natural gas .
You can prevent the disease from the disease .
Almost none of them are UNK .
They 're so far away .
And one of my favorites , my favorite , is much better than the ' 80s .
There are two big UNK in this world .
The UNK UNK in the United States , UNK UNK and UNK UNK , which had 16 different cases of death in the last two continents , and there were 16 different risk of death in the last two continents , and then there 's a UNK risk of dying .
So why is this important ? Well , first of all , it 's very important for the UNK of ecosystems .
The UNK is the nature of nature .
And then they eat UNK in their bodies .
And they can take the bacteria out of all the bacteria , and they can get rid of the UNK of the virus and UNK the UNK and the animals that make a lot of UNK and UNK of death and disease .
And what we 've seen in recent studies is that there are three times more UNK in the UNK of UNK in the UNK of the UNK and UNK of the disease and UNK of the disease .
There 's a lot of history of history .
And they have a common relationship with ancient ancient culture .
The UNK in UNK were the UNK of the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK , the UNK and the UNK , the UNK and the UNK and the UNK .
In the UNK , UNK UNK of UNK , he UNK his life in the UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' UNK ' '
In the culture of Tibet , it 's particularly important to say that in Tibet , where there 's nothing like that , where there 's nothing like that , where there 's nothing like that , and then there 's a natural body called UNK .
So where are we ?
And Kenya grew up in 2003 , and six of them are extinct .
A lot of UNK work in UNK , which is because of what happens when the animal is happening between animals and wildlife , UNK UNK , UNK , UNK , is the next victims of UNK .
In South Asia , a lot of countries like India and Pakistan , four UNK have been found extinct in Asia , which means that it 's going to be killed by 10 or 15 million years of the population that 's killed .
Now , UNK UNK has been banned in India , the government of UNK UNK in India .
Because there are UNK UNK in the UNK , UNK UNK in UNK , UNK UNK in the UNK area of UNK in India , as soon as possible as possible as possible as possible .
And Kenya is now the largest UNK plant plant : UNK UNK .
And I don 't believe in wind wind , but we should be going to call the government to think about it , because the wind of the wind is going to be two and UNK half .
They 're UNK birds .
In West Africa , some people had nothing to do with UNK UNK who had nothing to do with UNK and UNK .
And what are we doing ? We 're studying these UNK . We 're building them in them .
We tried to find the relationship between UNK and UNK .
And what we find is that they 're traveling through different countries , so if you just focus on a region , you 're difficult to make progress .
We need to work together with the local government .
We 're trying to communicate with local communities .
We 're trying to figure out what they know about UNK , and then it has to be grateful to be grateful to be able to be able to be able to paint these amazing organisms and their contribution to the natural nature of nature .
And what can you do ? You can do that , you can do it , and you can write your government and tell them , and we need to go back and look at the UNK of people who are in trouble , and we need to focus on people who are very serious creatures , as much as possible .
And when you get this room , you 're UNK UNK , and it 's just telling your family , and tell your neighbors to talk about UNK stories .
They 're beautiful . And Darwin had said that he changed his mind , and he saw UNK in the air , UNK UNK in the sky .
In Kenya , there will be a big loss in the world where there 's a wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
And many of us , we can help people in a lot of different ways to help us change lives .
We can 't really be able to meet our neighbors , so even if we 're living in the same kind of public space space , it 's not going to be accepted .
And so in the last couple of years , I tried to find different ways of UNK , UNK and UNK , these simple tools for public space and neighbors in public space .
And these are all the questions that come from my own , how much time my neighbor is there ?
How are we going to be able to UNK each other from the back from the back of the neighborhood and to avoid the door ?
How are we going to share the UNK of our UNK and be better looking at understanding the land of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of
How can we perceive our UNK in the UNK of UNK and dream of what our community is going to tell us , is that our needs of hope and dream ?
And I 'm living in New Orleans and I love to love this city in New Orleans .
And the UNK of these UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK UNK , who always came to UNK , who was always UNK in the UNK of the painting of the music , I was sure that it was a UNK city of music .
When one of you , I felt a UNK team .
New Orleans has many of the most beautiful buildings , but at the same time , she 's the most UNK urban building .
And I lived in this house , and I wanted to figure out how it becomes a better place in this community , and it really changed my life .
In 2009 , I lost a man who I loved .
Her name is UNK , and to me , she died for my mother , she died .
And then I think a lot about what death looks like about death , and that 's what led me to my life when I had my life UNK and I had the real meaning of everything I had in my life .
But I was very difficult in my life .
And I think it 's a very easy thing to forget about how it 's very easy and forget what 's going on right now .
And then as a result of my UNK , I was able to get a UNK wall that I wrote on top of my house , and I was able to tell you the story of the same thing that I had in my house and to share some of them in the public and to share their hearts in their own lives .
And I didn 't know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , the entire wall was filled with all sorts of different answers .
And I wanted to share some of them in the wall that I wrote on the wall .
" Before the death , I wanted to be on my UNK . "
" Before you die , I wanted to get the UNK date . "
" before you die , I would love in a thousand audience . "
" Before you die , I think a tree . "
" Before the dead life , I wanted to see my life . "
" Before you die , I wanted to marry her again . "
" Before death , I wanted to be a UNK . "
" Before death , I wanted to be completely true . "
And this is what happened when I was a very bad building , and that was that I wanted to be a UNK , UNK UNK , which had led me to my courage .
And that makes us believe that we are not alone .
And let 's see how we have a whole community of ideas .
And this is what we 've created a new space and thinking about what we 've been trying to grow in the process of what 's going on in the process of change .
And this is what I 've been doing in my last year and then I get some passionate people that tell me how my colleagues and my colleagues built in their community , and so , my colleagues and my colleagues and my colleagues , who 've been working on their own community , is now in the middle of the United States , and then there are the UNK in the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK .
And these signs are saying , if we can share the opportunity between ourselves and share the opportunity with somebody else , it 's going to be a big role in public space .
And one of the most valuable things that we have , the one is time , one is the connection .
And in this UNK era of UNK , remember , UNK and UNK are becoming more important than ever before ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever had ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever had ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
We don 't have the courage to talk about death and even without courage to think about death , but I realize that it 's the most powerful thing we can do .
Think about death will make you happier enough about your life .
Public space can be better for what 's better than what we are , and to share our hope for ourselves and to be able to share a better place for us and to help us create a better place in which we can be able to make better places better than we 've been able to create better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I was in the UNK of UNK in Ghana .
The air UNK in the air , it 's very difficult to breathe with UNK .
And I can feel the UNK of UNK UNK from my UNK , but in the darkness , I can 't see anything else .
And I heard that there were words , but there was a lot of UNK UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK .
And as a man , I had a hole in the front of my head that I had a UNK UNK in my leg , and I had a UNK UNK in my feet , and I had a UNK UNK in my UNK , and I had a UNK UNK in the UNK of a UNK UNK UNK in my UNK .
And my hand was going to see that , immediately , thinking about the UNK before I had my hands , he UNK UNK UNK in the UNK .
And when I stand here today with those girls who are living in this room , there 's no money , there 's no money , there 's no money left .
And then I ended up walking home and then I was never going to go home and I was going to never be able to leave that day when I was born .
In the last 28 years , I 've been working on the UNK of the West , and in 2009 , I was very fortunate to be proud of UNK in 2009 , and I was very fortunate to be a UNK UNK in 2009 , and I was very fortunate to be a UNK UNK in 2009 , and I was very fortunate to be a UNK UNK in 2009 .
And I met a lot of people who met me , who I knew a UNK who was working on a UNK organization that was working on the UNK of modern society .
And we were talking about it , and I was really beginning to really understand what I was doing , although I had all the time that I was born in the West , but I had no idea what was going on in the United States .
And at the end of the conversation , I felt pretty bad that I had to say , I had no doubt how much I had to be able to see if I had a very , very difficult understanding of what it was like , okay , and how many of you know , or maybe how many of you ?
And this idea was given me hard for weeks after a few weeks , and then I flew in Los Angeles and I wanted to see George UNK 's office , wanted to make a difference .
And it started in my UNK journey .
And the strange thing about it , I 've been .
Some of them should be my second trip .
But again , I 'm going to UNK all of these secrets .
It 's more conservative than people in the world today .
This number is about two times more UNK than the UNK of Africa .
150 years ago , a UNK price of UNK had three times more than the average American UNK in America .
That 's 50,000 dollars per year .
But on today , the cost of a generation of UNK has been killed by 18 million dollars .
And it was amazing that there was something more than a million dollars per year in the world .
And many of them are being UNK by UNK UNK , good job , to be able to get out of good education and good jobs to work with respect and be able to get rid of that .
Now this is what 's happening in commercial terms of commercial value is the value of producing value , but the value is UNK .
There 's almost every single corner in the world in the middle of the world , even though it 's illegal .
In India and Nepal , I was brought to UNK .
And it was a very strange thing , just like walking into a UNK or UNK .
In 50 degrees of hot , women , women , a child , is a whole family of UNK UNK in the UNK of a UNK , and then UNK with a half of a UNK truck from UNK of a UNK truck .
And the UNK and the UNK were in front of their UNK , and after all the rest of his hand , he 's 16 and a half days for 17 hours .
And instead of walking out , you can 't eat , you can 't eat water , they don 't need a toilet .
There was no UNK in the left and UNK my camera , and my camera couldn 't be able to do that .
And for about 20 minutes , I had to get my device back in the air , and I put it in the air , and I sat in the air , and I sat in front of my car , and then I sat in a car and I sat there and I sat in a room that would be better than the camera I wanted to be .
And then back to UNK , I wanted to be crying , but my UNK UNK came back to me , and he said , " Don 't cry . Don 't cry . "
And then he said to me that in the place where I was there , it was dangerous to me that it was dangerous for me , for those workers .
And I had no way to give it back .
I can 't give them money . I 'll never .
I 'm not a nation .
And my behavior is probably going to be going to be worse than that .
And I can only focus on the UNK that I believe in the system , I believe that they can do that .
And then , as I had to get back home , I had to wait for my family .
In the Himalayas , I saw a UNK kid doing a few kilometers away from the UNK of a UNK truck waiting for the streets .
Those are the kids who are going to UNK their children with a UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK
And this is what it looks like when you see a UNK like this .
How are we going to overcome these hidden UNK ?
Some people don 't even think they 're going to be UNK at a very long time because they 're born like this .
There 's no way .
And if these people get their freedom for free , they burn their homes .
And these men , they get bad , they wanted to give up , but they were working in the middle of the neighborhood where they were going to help them to get their local UNK , and they were going to be free , and then they were free , and then they had the freedom that they had , and then they had the freedom of freedom , and then they had the freedom that they had , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them , and then they had freedom for them to
UNK UNK is one of the most often I want to hear about UNK , because I 've been told to say that when I 'm going to read this industry , I 'm not going to be able to get rid of that as I 'm going to see this industry , I 'm going to cut out this industry , and I 'm not going to tell you how my life is safe and to be safe .
And in my UNK , I was a woman who had died in front of me with a woman 's UNK .
And then they took me in front of a UNK staircase in a UNK .
This isn 't a UNK .
It 's more like a restaurant .
The restaurants in the middle are UNK UNK in UNK .
And one of the girls who had girls and girls had to be seven and a half a lot of food and a young woman who had to ask their customers to be able to get more food and more food .
And each of these UNK UNK is the dark side of the wall with a UNK wall .
People in this work are usually UNK UNK .
And remember that it was in a dark moment when I had a deep fear of fear that I wanted to be stuck on in my mouth .
There 's only one more like this one : This is the staircase in my UNK .
There 's no UNK .
There was no window .
And those who can 't stop that much of what you have to do with such a difficult topic is to know that there 's no real thing about it , including UNK in the backyard of our own backyard .
Hundreds of thousands of people became a UNK .
And recently , in New York Times , there were 100,000 people in the United States who had a UNK child being built into a UNK .
And something happened in us . We just don 't know .
The industry is often what we hear when we hear a lot of labor .
I visited a village in India in India , UNK UNK .
This is a man called " UNK . "
And then the guy with a black hand , the blue blue and red hand belongs to two sons .
And then they burn fuel in the UNK , and then UNK them in a UNK , and then there was a lot of UNK on the other side of the UNK , which is toxic .
Let me tell my story .
" We didn 't have the UNK . They said .
And we still hope , well , can get rid of this room , where you can get money .
And it may have been estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the world where there are UNK in the world .
And we got there , and I went to see a UNK .
And I saw a man who had two brothers in the boat and a few of them were like , well , right ?
Yes ! They 're all there .
The kids are forced to sell from their homes , and they 're working in a UNK job , and they 're not swimming .
This is eight years old .
When our boat was closer , he was in his UNK , he UNK his UNK in his UNK .
And he was afraid that would be going to fall .
And on the bottom of the UNK UNK in the ocean , these were often going to UNK the police and to UNK the police in the water .
A lot of people died .
From him in a long way , that 's what he 's doing in his UNK .
And he was very scared , and he was not going to get rid of his UNK , he had a very bad way for him to do it with him .
And I saw these guys in the morning in the morning -- they started working in the morning , and then they started working in the morning .
And then there was a very cold night , UNK UNK .
You know , there 's a thousand pounds out of the fish in the line of fish .
I 'll talk to you about UNK .
He runs out from a UNK .
And he saw him on a restaurant in a restaurant called UNK .
And he 's in the picture of his UNK , and he 's got a UNK , and the good news is that all of you can get a living in your body and to make sure that your family is safe and to make sure that your safety is safe .
There 's a potential for the UNK of UNK .
Because there 's something that 's going on right now , is the impact on his life .
And driving driving a UNK with a UNK with the UNK with the UNK , he 's got a UNK in UNK , and then it 's going to get closer to our cars , and it 's going to be in a UNK .
And he made us to go for him to a UNK that was able to get him .
At the end of the road , he UNK us out of the car .
And then he said , " Well , he 's not going to see the UNK , " that 's the road . Go ! "
We had a UNK UNK in the UNK of UNK UNK in my UNK that I had to photograph my UNK in the UNK UNK UNK in the UNK .
And then there 's two hours of UNK UNK in front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the front of the UNK in front of the UNK in front of us .
And a lot of women are wearing their kids , and they 're walking in a UNK .
It 's the UNK .
These people were UNK in high school in Ghana .
And when they get into a UNK like this .
And I remember that they had a lot of UNK in the blue eye , and a lot of them are tired of working on a UNK .
There are so much 90 meters of 90 meters in their UNK , where these rocks are separated from each other , and then there 's a UNK in the other area where it comes to the UNK of gold .
In fact , the man 's UNK UNK , but we 've got a little bit of UNK in the background where there 's a disability and there 's a few kids , and there 's a few kids in the edge .
They were victims of UNK .
And in fact , the men who have these muscles are going to be UNK years old and they may be UNK by UNK and tuberculosis .
This is UNK . When his father died , he sold him to work on his UNK .
And after his uncle died , he had to continue his uncle 's UNK , and he had to keep working in a shop .
And as I saw him , he had been working on a UNK in a very high way , as well as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as
And even though he had tuberculosis , he had tuberculosis , even though , he had to be working in a very long job .
And even then , he 's dream of being able to be free in this organization , to be able to support education so that it can be difficult to imagine that it 's very difficult to imagine suffering .
And I hope that we are UNK .
And when I was in a photograph , I took a lot of candles in the translator , I wanted my photograph to be a UNK , and I wanted to light their story and their UNK , and when we were safe , I made a series of pictures of those stories when we were safe .
And they know that these images are going to be outside .
And I wanted to know that what we 're going to do for them first , is to change the lives of their lives .
And I really believe that when we UNK them , it 's very difficult to be UNK .
And these images are not about issues , but it 's the real human being , you know , it 's about living in your life , dignity and respect .
I didn 't have a day that I wanted to see , but I had no idea that I could meet people that I was able to meet .
And I wanted these images to be a UNK , and I hope that the power of UNK could be the UNK of the UNK , because there is no light on the UNK that will continue to live in the shadow of the UNK .
Thank you .
And one of the things that I learned in my study is that we have a special problem in every study of UNK , which is the kind of thing we 've been working with .
Nobody knows what we are .
So I 'm going to show you some examples of what we are doing .
Well , dance is one of the human activity .
And we feel like UNK UNK and UNK UNK , and you 'll know .
Now , it 's time to be extraordinary professional professional knowledge and UNK creative skills , and it 's possible that there 's a gift .
But , unfortunately , the nervous disease , for instance , is slowly going on in my friend 's UNK , he 's in my friend 's UNK UNK , who is his friend 's UNK .
And that 's a lot of treatments in these years .
And yet , there are UNK of the UNK of this disease , and they can still be treated with UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , etc . We need the objective tools to detect .
And we need to measure the target of the progress of the last time , to know that the best part of the last time is to understand what 's going on in the lower world is what it means to be able to be able to figure out what 's wrong with those problems .
But surprisingly , UNK diseases with other movements and other movements , is that you can 't do simple blood pressure , and what you can 't do is you can do the very simple blood pressure if you can do simple things that we can do with 20 minutes of time .
You 've got to get clinics , and there 's a very large number of it , which has never been done in clinical trials , never before .
But what if patients could do this test ?
And could that be there for patients who are going to save the clinic , if they can do this test ?
You don 't need a lot of money to hire employees .
And by the way , if you go to a UNK clinic , you can have 300 dollars .
And so I wanted to ask you about one of the ways that we can try to do it , because you know , in a sense , at least in a way , at least , at least in a way , at least in a sense of art .
I 've got a video about UNK UNK .
And this is one of the UNK who 's health , we think of as a sound of sound , because when we 're listening to each other , we need to combine these sounds of sound , you know , in fact , for example .
And at the same time , it needs a special training .
You know , a kid who has to spend a lot of time .
In sound , we can get rid of the UNK in your UNK , which is the UNK of what you can do with your eye .
You can see the UNK in the bottom is a UNK UNK .
And we saw the same symptoms .
Sound UNK , UNK and UNK .
And it 's going to be UNK when it 's going to be more UNK .
And in fact , most of those things are difficult to be UNK , but only any of the digital robots that are going to have a very advanced computer test software is now working on top of the rest of the world , and so now we 'll be able to see exactly the same thing about health and the disease and the other side of the line so that it 's just as important as possible .
So they 're going to do this with a basic test , how are they going to do this ? In fact , they 're not innovative .
The UNK test is UNK , and it 's the infrastructure of the existing system .
You don 't have to design a series of new hospitals .
They 've got it all the time . And although it 's , it 's not just like a computer test .
And that means that patient can do this .
And it 's faster . It 's about 30 seconds .
It 's very low . We know how to do it .
And once the price is high , you can grow .
And here are the great targets I 'm going to show you .
We can reduce the UNK of the patient .
Don 't pay attention to the clinic .
And we can do this in a UNK search for a target .
And we can do a lot of UNK in clinical trials , and we can do it very low , and we can make the amount of the amount of numbers that are going to be possible in the first time .
And we also have the opportunity to figure out what it looks like in the early UNK of UNK .
So let 's start with the first step here in this direction , we started UNK UNK .
And we 've got a lot of UNK working together , and we 're going to record all of the sound of the stuff in the world all around the world to get here four targets .
Our UNK number is three billion people on the planet .
Anyone who has a health and a UNK UNK that will leave you with a little bit of money , just as long as I 've been told you , I was happy about what we were going to do in eight hours in eight hours .
Thank you .
Kevin , for these UNK UNK , you can see who are healthy , who is it ?
So what do you want from all these ?
Yes , yes , you 'll tell you that you have this disease if you 've got this disease .
You know , some of you may never say , or not .
But we still get a lot of data from different environments , and the point is different environments , because we can get rid of those kinds of these kinds of things that are going on .
So , you 've got the UNK in the back here ?
It 's beyond .
In fact , my students ' UNK , I had to mention him because he made a cool job , and now he has demonstrated the UNK of the 99 percent of the path here , so now we 're close to 99 percent of the story of what 's going on .
UNK , good , that 's a cool thing .
So it means that people can actually take a phone with your phone and say , they can be able to paint the phone and say to my doctor , and then they can see their progress in the future of where they 're in this disease .
That 's all .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
And since I was there , I 've been UNK photography , but I 'd like to share with you today about 15 minutes of my favorite picture , and they didn 't have a picture .
There is no art , there is no new opportunity , and there are no words left .
In fact , most of them are UNK UNK .
And my story from my story , my UNK UNK , my wife , my wife , is my wife , and I was wearing my daughter of my daughter , and I was sitting on the UNK of my brother and the UNK ' 80s .
And after a year , we went back to New York City , so we decided to take a look at the same picture .
You can see how it works .
And when I was 16 years old , my wife said , " Hey , why don 't you take a look at New York City from New York to go to this high school ? "
And that 's what we started with the street from the back of the road .
You know , to put a camera in a completely UNK image of how it 's UNK .
Nobody was going to say , well , fortunately nobody had to take our cameras off .
And then , we don 't know the journey of this journey with the way that we live .
And for us , it becomes sacred .
This is after 9 / 11 , and then I tried to explain what 9 / 11 day tried to do this .
So these pictures are longer than just recorded a moment , or a very special journey .
And what they were looking at was the last time in front of the last week , when we started thinking about what it was , then how we changed in the past year and how we had changed from the end of how we changed , and how we change in the year , is something that we change , not only of the time , but is the change in which it 's changed as well as the rest of the planet , but is the change in which it 's changed as well as the rest of the planet , but is the change in which it 's changed .
Because when I took the same picture , our eyes and I was different from my eyes , and my eyes looked up , and saw how she felt about how it felt , how she saw how she felt , how she saw how she felt .
It 's time for us to get involved in a year , and one of the things that 's going on in a year is the most difficult time .
And in the last time , we walk in the road , and she immediately stopped , and she said to her a long time at the bottom of the wall .
She was looking at the scene when she was about five .
She said she saw the first time to see that UNK in her life , that it was nine years ago .
And now she went to New York in college , because she decided to go to New York .
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we 've created is our memories .
And so I wanted to share with you the idea of taking this sense of conscious consciousness and creating a memory of memory .
And I don 't know about you , but my personal , but for 15 minutes , I can 't see in my UNK a little bit of a photograph .
And I was always a UNK .
And I wanted to encourage you , to go to the photo , to be there , to be UNK , to go to UNK , " Can you help us ? "
Thank you .
