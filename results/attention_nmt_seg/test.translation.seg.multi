And when I was 11 , I remember one day in my morning , I was listening to be happy .
And my dad was using his gray radio radio news .
And he had to be quiet , and he had to see a lot of the news , because most of the news is going to be frustrated .
" The Taliban came . " he was called .
And I don 't know what that means , but I can see that he 's very happy .
" You can go to a real school . " he said .
I never forget that morning .
A real school .
When I was six years old , the Taliban had Afghanistan and UNK girls and UNK girls .
And so in that five years , my brother and I had a good school to go to a secret school , and it was no longer any time to go off .
It 's the only way that we have all of us .
We 're going to get a different path in a different way , so we don 't know where we 're going .
We think that we 're going to get into the house in the food store , so we just want to go shopping .
The school is in a house , and we are in a small room .
It 's very comfortable in winter , but it 's hot .
And we all know that it 's dangerous and the teachers , the students and the parents .
And sometimes it 's going to be a week that school had a week because of the Taliban .
We are worried that we 're going to be discovered by the Taliban .
Where are we tracking ?
Do they know where we are ?
We are scared , but we still want to go to school .
And I was fortunate to grow as a doctor in a UNK and UNK .
My grandfather was interested in his early days .
And he was in Afghanistan , and there was a lot of UNK , that he had been working on his daughter , my mom , to go to school , and then she had to go to his father and his father to go to his father .
But I was a mother in education who was a teacher .
That 's her .
She was three years ago , and it turned back into a school school and women and women .
And my father -- that 's him -- he was the first of the family 's first person in education .
And so , his children should be educated , including his daughter , although a lot of them , even a risk .
And for him , children don 't accept education as a child of education .
And I remember when I was in the Taliban in Afghanistan , and I remember sometimes I would feel that I would be afraid of my life and I would be afraid of what I was going to be afraid of .
And I thought I wanted to give up , but my dad would say , " Listen , my daughter , you may have anything you lose . "
Your money may be UNK , you may be UNK .
And the only thing you 're going to be able to do is , if we have to sell the blood out of your home , then we 'll do it again .
Even all you need ? "
And now I 'm 22 .
I was born in a long country that had been destroyed by decades .
When I was a woman in my age , high school in high school , when it wasn 't my family , I would be as most of my family .
And now I 've been a proud year-old UNK .
And one of the things that happened in the United States of the United States in America was when I was back to Afghanistan when I was back to Afghanistan when I was back to Afghanistan when I was back to Afghanistan when I was 15 years old , and the first thought I was going to get was in school when I was asked to be educated .
And he was just not just because my university , because it was the first time I was the first , in a woman , and I was the first driving to be the first driving man in the streets of UNK .
My family trust me .
My dream is , but they are better for me .
This is the reason why I became a global UNK , which is a global organization in which a lot of women are working with women .
And that was the reason that I was working on UNK , which was the first thing that maybe Afghanistan was still in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , there was a lot of girls in education , because in Afghanistan , there was a lot of girls in education .
And as soon as I was , I saw my students in my school would be able to get a chance of opportunity .
And I saw their parents , especially with my father , just like my father , although they saw their fear .
For example , that 's not the name , and I can 't let you see his face , he 's the father 's father .
And no one month before his daughter , he had died in the back of the streets when they died .
And then he was in his house , he said , " If he was going to work to school school , he would be happening if he was going to come to school .
" If you think , it 'll kill me now , " he said , " but I 'm not going to be in the future of my daughter . "
In Afghanistan , I realized -- this is the Western state -- it 's the history of my life -- it 's the good thing that we 're successful -- that it 's the success of the daughter of the daughter , the success of his daughter , is the success of his success , is the success of his success .
It doesn 't mean that mothers are not important in our success .
In fact , in the good future of our daughters , they were always the first UNK , but in Afghanistan , we had to have men .
In the Taliban , there were hundreds of people who had been working for school -- they didn 't forget . It was illegal .
But today , Afghanistan , Afghanistan , is already more than three million years .
Afghanistan and America have a big difference .
And I found that American Americans can see the UNK of change .
And I was worried that changed in the United States .
But when I went back to Afghanistan and saw my students and support their parents , I was looking at the future of hope , and I saw that change .
And for me , Afghanistan had been hoping for hope and UNK , and every single day , every day , my girls at the UNK of every day was reminded me .
Like me , they had a lot of dreams .
Thank you .
Everything that I do , whether I 've been working on and on and on and on and on and on and on , is that seven years of my life in Africa is that in Africa .
From Texas to Texas , I saw a young man , but it was my last year when I was in prison , Kenya , UNK , UNK , and had been working on the UNK of the UNK of Africa in Africa .
I was working in a company called UNK , and we had failed every project in Africa .
And I was pretty quick .
I think we were 21 years old , and we were working on a lot of what we were doing in Africa .
And yet , what do we do with something ?
And our first project to write my first book , called " UNK , " in this project , we wanted to teach UNK UNK .
And so , we took a seed in Italy to get to the UNK , the UNK , to the UNK , and we teach a lot of UNK and UNK and so on .
And of course , there 's no interest in it , so we pay for the money , and then they don 't go for a long time .
It 's so heavy that there 's a lot of things that people don 't know very well .
But we didn 't ask them , but just one of them was , " Let 's do it . "
" UNK " is a UNK when a UNK UNK a UNK .
And of course , there 's a good job in Africa .
We are beautiful . In Italy , it 's a big big number of money ; it 's going to be long enough for a long time .
It 's unbelievable . We say , " Look , that 's much easier . "
And when it 's heavy , it 's a UNK , a night , a night , a night , from the UNK of a UNK , from a UNK in the UNK .
And we were like , " God , these are the UNK . "
" Yes , that 's what we don 't have here for here . "
" Why don 't you ? " " You don 't ask . "
And I thought that one of the things that we used in Africa was that in Africa , when I knew that the United States , the French of France , is that , when you go to the United States , it 's very proud of what 's going on .
Because at least we 're going to get a UNK .
You 've got to see these waste -- -- you 've got to see if we 've got the waste of what 's going on in Africa .
You can read this book , it 's called " The UNK , " and one of them is about UNK .
This book was published in 2009 .
We 've been in Africa in the last 50 years in Africa .
I 'm not going to talk about the damage that 's going to happen to you .
You 've got to read it .
You can see how many of the damage that we 've seen in Africa .
We are UNK , UNK , UNK , and we 're looking for two : one of us , one of the parents , the parents , the parents , the UNK , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents , the parents
And these two words come from UNK UNK , UNK , UNK .
But two words are different .
And the parents meant that I was a kid with my kids , " I love your kids . "
And I wanted to talk to you about what I mean by my cultural background .
And that 's why it 's written in Africa called " UNK . "
And as I was reading a book , the book of the book was called " The UNK of UNK , " one of the most important things , to be the most important , is , if people don 't want people to help other people , just go back .
It should be about aid .
The first principle of aid aid is to respect .
And that morning , when I had this meeting , was put on the front of this conference , say , " Could we can -- can you imagine a city that doesn 't have a new lot of problems ? "
And at the age of my age , when I decided that I wanted to help 't help , and I set up a job system called UNK , which we don 't even do , but we don 't have to be able to get anyone who 's a better job for the people , and that for the local people , it 's a better job for the local people .
So what we need to do -- it 's shut off .
We go in a community where it 's not going to be UNK or whatever you 're talking about .
There 's no work in the office .
We met with our clients and UNK .
We don 't have any infrastructure .
And what we do is , we know their interest and UNK them .
And the most important thing is passion .
You can ask yourself your ideas .
But if you 're not interested , what you have ?
The client is the most important thing to improve .
Your passion is based on the basis of self , which is the most important .
And then we can help them with knowledge and information , because there 's no lights in the world , UNK UNK .
You can 't understand it with your knowledge , but we 're going to be able to support it .
And so many years ago , I had a thought that we couldn 't be able to do a good job at least at least , but instead of what 's going to happen ?
I tell you a secret .
There 's a problem in the community .
And they weren 't supposed to be able to tell you , they would say , they 'll tell you what they 're going to be in public .
So it 's got a UNK .
You don 't even have people in the community , because they don 't care about their public UNK .
And what we do is , with our customers , we have to be able to build a UNK society .
We have to create a whole career .
And it 's a government doctor , a commercial doctor doctor , and when you 're standing in your house , your kitchen , or your wife , help you , you know , your neighbor 's going on and forth to your businesses and to raise your business and be able to make sure that you 're going to be in your business and be able to change your business and make it into the freedom of life .
And I spent a trial in UNK UNK .
And at that time I was reading Dr. UNK , working with UNK and UNK .
And one of the first people I 've been working on the last year , and I 've been working on the UNK , and I teach him that there 's no money in the house , and then he 's going to sell him to the UNK , and he 's working with him , and he said , " You , what you need to sell ? Are you going to sell fish ? "
And I had this five UNK of UNK , not to the UNK , to be able to sell a crash in the UNK of 60 and a half dollars a day , and then a farmer came back to me , and I said , " So , you 've got to help them , which is , " and you can help us ? "
And one year , one of the things that I 've done in my last year , the government of government started to ask me , " How did you do that ?
And I was like , " I 've done a very difficult thing .
And that was , " Hey , listen to what they said . "
And -- so people are saying , " Well , that 's what it does . "
We started with 300 communities in the world .
And we 've helped to build a UNK company .
A new generation of entrepreneurs are doing so well .
UNK , the greatest policy of UNK , a few years ago , a few years ago , 11 years old .
And one of the things that happened when I was a philosophy professor at UNK , UNK UNK , was said , " UNK is the UNK economy of UNK and entrepreneurs . "
And the plan was to help business help .
Now , what we 're trying to do now is , we don 't know how many people in the world know how to use their own money and their money .
We have to learn how to make them .
We have to give them the reward , and respect their privacy , and so they 'll be able to help us , and then they 'll be happy .
In a community community , we have 200 customers .
Can you imagine how much a community is , how does it be ?
How many of you are today ?
It 's a very popular community . You 're better for them .
And so what I want to say is that business is the UNK of today .
When we 're at the end of the first time in the first time of industrial revolution -- we use it , we use it , we use it , we use it , we can actually change it , but we realize it 's very sustainable .
There was a crash in which a crash was going to get off .
It 's UNK food with a UNK diet .
And we 're going to be concerned about how we are in a sustainable way of looking at the food of seven and healthcare and education and exchange demand .
There 's nothing left to be done with our technology .
Who can be invented with this technology ? universities ? Don 't think !
government ? Don 't think .
It 's about entrepreneurs and they are working for that .
And a couple of years ago I saw a funny article in the UNK magazine .
UNK , a team of experts were invited to talk about what the future of the city was .
And that 's the UNK , and one of the people of this is that they 've made it all over 100 percent of the back of the last three years , and then , in the last two years , New York City is going to be the right time : 100 years later , New York City is going to go .
Why ? Because as they looked at the graph , if the population continues to grow like this speed , New York was able to be able to do with six meters of UNK in New York City .
And then it 's going to be UNK .
So UNK , they thought , technology is going to kill the lives of New York .
So what happened then , when 40 years after then , when 40 years , then , there 's a UNK UNK in the United States of UNK cars .
There 's a new technology that 's new , and we have a lot of UNK and UNK .
So , for instance , the UNK of the UNK UNK UNK .
And yet , it 's got a secret to do .
First of all , you 're going to give them the reward .
Otherwise they don 't need you to talk about talking about what you 're talking about .
And then you 've got to be able to get care for yourself .
You 've got to tell them about their personal UNK .
Whether it 's a large company or a small company , it 's got to be good for three things : the product of the product , and the market is very efficient and financial management .
So what 's the problem ?
There was no one in the world who was able to make a difference , selling and financial job .
There 's no place there .
It 's extinct .
And we 've done this research , which is , in the world 's 100 million companies working in the world -- UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the Google , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK
There 's only one of the commercial companies in the world who have only been created by one who doesn 't have a company .
And now we started working on the UNK in UNK , and it was the first time that these students had been working on was that these students were working on UNK and UNK , which was the word " UNK " and how many of them used " the word " and " the word " and " we used " the word " the word " the word " and " we used " the word " the word " the word " and " we used " the word " the word " the word " and " we used " the word " the word " the word " the word " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and
And just one day , " we used about nine .
And he was just three years before he was there .
Nobody was able to build a company . No one .
And so we can build a community where we have the UNK of a computer company , and we can ask you , we 'll ask you , " What are you going to do with you ? " and what you need ?
What can you do ? You can get it ?
Can you get out ? Can you get money ? "
" Ah , did not I help you ? "
We inspire local communities .
And we 've got a team of volunteers who are working with entrepreneurs , and we 've found out that there 's a system that can change the culture of the community , the power of the community , the ability , the ability you get people into this passion , the ability , the imagination , the imagination , the imagination .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I had been a UNK in my UNK .
And then gave me the teachers at the University of teaching me to learn how to teach students to learn students .
And I was scared .
And I was scared of all the time , and the students of these students , they read the UNK and they had the UNK word that they had , and they had been UNK .
But when it happened , my experience is , as it was , as it was , it had been the UNK of a new world in the last hole .
And that 's what I was talking about when these students were going to be surprised , and I wanted people to experience the feeling in the wild .
And I 'm sure it 's going to be really good in the last door to help .
In order to change the world , we need to have a good exchange from our scientists and engineers .
And our scientists and our engineers are part of what we face , and when we don 't understand what we don 't understand , and I 'm sure that we have a responsibility to do with them , and I 'm sure that we have a responsibility to do with them .
But if our scientists and engineers are not allowed to go out of our UNK and look at their UNK , we don 't have the very good communication .
So scientists and engineers , let 's start with what we 've come up with .
And I 'd like to share a few ways , tell you how you can make your science , your engineering UNK , your engineering UNK .
The first is to answer the question : What 's the technology ?
And tell us , why 's your science and what we know about it .
Don 't tell me what you 've been working with UNK UNK , to tell you that skeleton is important because it 's very important .
The other thing you can describe when you describe scientific principles .
And the idea is that we understand what you know with your ideas .
And of course , you can say , " UNK , " you don 't say " space " and " time , " it 's so much easier for us .
The idea of ideas is simple and not UNK .
Instead , as Einstein said , all of you are as simple as possible .
You don 't have to have to change your mind with your mind .
You can think of a few examples of stories , stories , UNK , and these are the things that you want to talk about and what we are excited .
And what 's going on here is that in the back of the slide , you don 't have to be UNK .
Do you want to say , " Well , why don 't you better than a UNK ? "
And what 's the crash ? The UNK , you know , you can get extinct .
And it 's not just boring like this slide , but it 's dependent on the language of our brains to us .
And one of the things that made a lot of that was made by UNK UNK , is that it 's what we call the UNK structure of the UNK , or even the UNK design of the UNK .
And the idea is that we can be able to be able to understand the story , the UNK , the UNK , and then we 'll be able to figure out what you can do , and then we 'll be able to detect something that we can describe , and then we can tell the difference between what 's going on .
And these are the things that I think we can help us open up here and see science and engineering .
And that 's why I 've been working with engineers that I 've been working on my UNK in my mind , I wanted to say something with a equation that I was going to do with my mind .
The science of science you 've been working with you , the idea that you 're going to share with you , is to share the passion and the audience that you 're doing on yourself , and it 's going to be what you really understand , and it 's amazing .
And so scientists and engineers , when you 've solved the idea , it 's going to be a lot of time , to talk about the technology I 'm talking about .
Thank you .
And one of my favorite English is called " UNK . "
Not just because it sounds good .
And it means " a politician for UNK . "
And even though it was the newspaper that had just one of the things that had had been the UNK of the night that he was able to say that he was a man who had nothing to do with a man or whatever it was , that he had nothing to do with it . "
I don 't know what the word is .
It 's about the word of words , I suppose .
But what it means is that the word is important to the political center , and all of those politicians understand they have to try to control their UNK .
For instance , it 's time until the British Council of UNK gave the news that the UNK of the press would tell you what 's going on .
And it 's true because of a man , this great name is called " UNK , " right now .
And he was killed in London , but he was very passionate about enough that he had enough courage in the election , and finally he had a lot of support in London that he had had a lot of support sound in London .
And only a couple of years ago , we had the first record with UNK UNK .
A lot of people thought it was the word " UNK . "
No , it comes from the news of the news .
But it 's true that we 're going to see that as real and politics and how it is , I wanted you to go back in the United States , when it 's just beginning to be called UNK .
And then they had a question that it was about to say , that 's how they were UNK , their leaders .
They don 't know .
What should be the leader of the United States ?
And that 's the question that we 've been talking about in Congress for a long time .
And it creates a lot of advice , the advice to change .
And I mean , some people want to call him UNK UNK , and some other people call him " UNK , " he 's called George UNK .
There was no UNK name .
Some of you are just trying to call him the king .
They thought it was a word that was used by the past .
And they didn 't even go back to the UNK , they were the only thing that you could have in the election of the election .
You know , it 's going to be possible .
And everybody had a good job , and actually , because it had three weeks after that .
And I read one of the guys , and the very good news , the UNK record , " The question is that . "
And the reason why it 's UNK and tired is that it 's the UNK ' 70s .
The queen did not want to leave Washington to the power of power .
They didn 't want to call him the UNK , or what he was able to do with him .
So they showed him what they wanted , where most of them , the most UNK , the most UNK .
This is called " UNK . "
This is the president of UNK . I mean , it 's the same story , but it 's called a meeting .
It 's the same thing as the UNK of the same thing .
And it doesn 't seem to be very impressive , UNK UNK and UNK .
And there 's something that there are very few kinds of people who don 't have a lot of money , but it 's really what it 's all about .
And that 's why they had sex .
And they said that this is really ridiculous . You can 't call him the meeting .
This guy had to be UNK and UNK .
Who are going to come up with him , if he has a UNK , a UNK , a UNK , a UNK , a UNK ?
And after three weeks of economists , it didn 't respond at all .
As a tool , they agreed to be true , but they were absolutely sure that they didn 't agree with the UNK of the UNK and the UNK , the UNK UNK , when they had the UNK , the UNK , the UNK of the United States , when they were , you know , the UNK of the UNK , the UNK of the UNK , when the UNK of the UNK , the UNK of the United States , who doesn 't want to be UNK by the UNK of the UNK , that we don 't want to be UNK by the UNK of a group of a UNK .
Now , in this story , you can know about what 's interesting interesting .
First of all , it 's the most favorite place that I can find out where I can find out that there are UNK UNK .
The president of the president , the president of the president , is still waiting for a long time .
And the second thing you can know is that when the U.S. government says that it 's just the temporary thing , it 's going to be a long time .
But the third thing that you can know about , and that 's a very important thing , I want you to remember that that 's the name of this man , the UNK of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States .
And it 's about more than a thousand percent of the economy , and that 's the largest economy in the world , and a lot of UNK and a lot of UNK .
And that 's what happened with the history of the history of history .
So it won 't happen .
And then they get their own UNK .
And the same thing that happened as well as it was that they had a lot of time listening , but it had a lot of fun in the back of the moment .
But now , how many of you know today 's president ?
UNK .
And that 's because they wanted to get their own names of names like that , but there 's about 5,000 species , etc .
And so , finally , the UNK won 't wait because they were told them , and when they were told they were the United States minister of the United States , and they were told that they were the United States of the United States .
And that 's a very important lesson , I think you 're going to learn , and I wanted to leave you .
And politicians tend to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to express meaning and control and control , but in fact , it 's going to change the reality of what 's going on .
Thank you very much .
And I was to go back 50 and a half a UNK , and my left home , I was 19 and I was living in a UNK UNK in Florida .
And what I used with my black UNK is UNK UNK with a UNK of UNK UNK , which is the UNK of government that I don 't know .
This was my first time in Afghanistan .
And at the end of the war , when I grew up in the war , I was looking at the UNK , and I was asked to be a little bit of a UNK and a woman 's UNK UNK , and said , " Don 't even know what it 's going to happen when it 's going to be kind of UNK . "
But that 's what it 's about .
And so I 'm standing here today with Afghanistan , and then God UNK me with a UNK and a radical political artist and all of living in Afghanistan and work in Afghanistan .
In Afghanistan , you can create a lot of good things , but one of the things that I don 't expect , I don 't want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the UNK of all of the UNK of the UNK of the UNK of the UNK , which is the UNK of the word that it 's important to understand the world that we 're living in .
And I wanted to talk to a war that he was in a UNK , and he was wearing a UNK , a UNK , a UNK , and for religious and political corruption .
And they were asked to be the president of the public and they got me , and I said , " I 'm a UNK , I 'm a UNK , " and what can you do ?
And I tried to figure out what it was like to be the president of the election , and that UNK was the hero of the nation .
And one of the things that I thought about was that in Afghanistan , look at the Israeli State in Afghanistan , and one of those kids would be working on the streets in Afghanistan , and then they decided to give them a good job , they wanted to get them back in the streets of Iraq and the president of the UNK and the president of the UNK and the president of the UNK and the president of the UNK and the UNK of the house that they had , for the first time , to be able to be able to get them in the front of Afghanistan that was given to us that 100 of Afghanistan was given to the United States .
And I wanted to know that what I 'm going to do with my mind is that in Afghanistan and how it comes from Afghanistan .
The war and the UNK of the UNK and the UNK of the UNK , which is the UNK process for the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK of Afghanistan that I 've been working on in Israel , and that 's the UNK of the UNK in Israel where it 's called the UNK UNK .
And one of the things that I wanted to put in the wall was that the UNK and the UNK UNK , who was looking at the UNK of a modern art , looking at the UNK of the UNK of the UNK of a UNK , or the UNK of the UNK , or to the UNK , even the UNK of the UNK , even the UNK of the UNK .
But they do these things , you might be UNK , and then you 'll be UNK by the prison .
But I did what I had to do with my self that I wanted to do .
That 's my help . What ?
Thank you .
Hi , I was a UNK in the past .
Well , 10 years old .
Now , I felt in this room that I was in this room , because I was not supposed to wear this man .
And that 's why I took the other .
This is the first time in the TED stage , and so I thought that people are lucky .
And if there was some women that I had , I thought I was going to tell me now , but I would be here in front of the Twitter .
And I wanted to tell you , I was fortunate enough to change the image of my mind in my eyes .
It 's not everything you can do .
And that 's a very good job . Okay , the good news is I don 't want to wear them .
And the worst news is that I 'm going to try to get myself in the middle of you , because it 's the moment I 'm going to remember I 'm going to do that , but I 'm not going to do that .
You can get it out .
So , why did I do that ?
It 's weird .
You don 't think so much about the picture .
It 's a powerful , but it 's also UNK .
And I just changed in the UNK of you in the front of your mind .
In this picture , I 'm actually a UNK in real life .
And when the photographer had got me out of the side of my man , I was very uncomfortable with that man .
And one of the things that 's going to work with my mind is that we don 't only change the way that we want to work in , because it 's possible that we don 't change the way we change things , even though it 's UNK , it 's very big and it 's very important to the lives of our lives .
So today , to me , to be honest , to be honest .
And today I 'm standing here because I 'm a model .
And I 'm here in this stage , because I 'm a beautiful UNK woman , and we call it " UNK . "
And I wanted to answer my questions , and I asked my questions , and I asked myself to be honest .
The first question is , how do you become a model model ?
And I was like , " I 'm finding out , but that 's what I mean . "
And one of the things that I was a model of was one of my genes , I was a big gene , I was a UNK , and I was a believer in which you may be .
Well , in the last few centuries in the last century , it 's not just healthy , young and small , but we have a UNK that we have , with women , the UNK , the color , the color , the color , the color , the color , the color , the color , the color , the color .
This is my legacy , and this is what I 've been working with .
And I know that some of you may be able to ask some kind of UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK and UNK UNK .
First of all , I 'm going to be able to respond to you with a profound sense of the UNK .
But unfortunately , I had to tell you , in 2007 , one of my friends in 2007 , when I was working on the New York , I was inspired by the UNK of UNK , which is at least 80 percent of all of the time , is that you don 't want to be UNK , it 's a UNK .
And the next thing is , my question is , " What am I going to do with ? "
And one of the first answer : " I don 't know , because they didn 't let me take it . "
But the second answer , is what I want to ask to you about what these girls are saying right ? "
You know ? You can choose any career .
You could be the president of the United States and the next generation of the United States , or a UNK , UNK , that 's the best thing , because you 're the first .
And if you listen about all these things , they say , " No , I want to say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say , " I 'll say ,
Because if I can 't , I can 't say anything you can be , or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " to " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " or " would be " or " or " or " would be " or " or " or " would be " or " or " or " would be " or " or " or " would be " or " or " or " would be " or " or " or " would be " or " or " or " would be " or " or " or " would be " or " or " or " or "
And you grow , when you grow , you say , you 're like , you 're like , you 're going to be UNK .
You can 't be a model model , but as it 's good , it 's not a UNK industry , but it 's not a UNK industry .
And I 'm going to show you some of the experience that I 've been working on my last 10 years , because it 's a UNK UNK .
And so what happens is that if you see the lights in front of the light here -- like this -- I want to take a look at a UNK in the back of the house , and then the arm is sitting in front of the side of the side of his face , and then back then back to your friends in front of you , 400 , 400 , 400 , five , 400 , 400 , five , five , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , five , five , four , four , four , four , four , five , five , four , four , four , four , five , five , four , four , four , four , five , five , six , four , five , four , four , five , six , six , five , six , four , four , five , six , six , five , six , four , four , five , six , six , six , six ,
It looks like this .
You don 't like it just like the middle .
I didn 't know how to do that .
And the reality is that when you 've graduated after that when you 've graduated and you 've done a bunch of jobs , you don 't have any of the time , but if you say you wanted to be the president of the United States , it 's about 10 years of UNK , and that 's what people are listening to look at you .
The next thing that people would say is : " Are they going to come up ? "
Yes , they 're going to have almost all the photos , but this is just a picture of work .
And that was the first model model , which was the first time I was wearing a lot .
And I know that it 's a private , but it was very young .
This is the picture that I took a few months ago .
This is a picture of a long time .
My friend was working with me .
This is the picture that I took when I read French UNK 's first couple of years ago .
This is the picture I was at Stanford magazine .
This is me now .
And I wanted you to see that it 's not my own .
And it was made by a group of experts who had a lot of experts , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and they made it , and then made it , and then made it .
The next question is , " Can you get free ? "
And I 've got too much of my chance in a lot of eight pounds , but that 's the only thing I 'm going to talk about today , and that 's the thing we don 't want to talk about .
And when I was growing up in UNK , I walked into a shop shop , and I left a shop in my shop , and I left a shop and sent them back .
And when I was 15 , my friend and I was a terrible driver , and we had a big man , and we said , " Sir , I 'm going to go ahead and we 're going to go back . "
And I got this because I was a UNK , not the identity of my identity , some of them .
And I was living in New York , last year when I was in New York City , and they were a young man and a UNK kid .
And the young men in New York and the UNK and the UNK are just UNK , so , " I 'm going to get into a tree ? "
" I 'm going to get a couple of times , " and what are I going ? "
And when I was working on this talk , I found that in the United States of this talk that there was a UNK in the United States of the United States in the United States of my house when it was 17 .
So the last question is , what is the idea of UNK ? "
And I guess the answer that they 're looking for is they 're going to be a little bit of " UNK , " and then you 'll be happy , you 'll be happy .
When we 're here , we 'll give up something like this .
And we said , " You know , we 've been working with creative and creative people , and we 're passionate about what 's going on . "
And that 's true , but it 's half of the fact , because we never say , I 'll say , I 'll say , " I 'm not a security . "
Because I had to worry when I was left my day .
And if you 've ever thought , if I was a little more hair , my hair would be better , I would be happier ?
You just go back to the model , because they 've got the UNK legs , the beautiful hair , the most beautiful and UNK , and they may be the most UNK woman in the world .
And so when I 'm ready for the talk , and I 've been looking for a lot of time and finding a balance , because , if I 'm standing here , I 'll be able to make a difference in my life , but if it doesn 't matter , then it doesn 't make me happy , it doesn 't make me happy , it doesn 't matter if it doesn 't make me happy .
But the most difficult thing is to go to the work with gender and UNK .
But at the same time that I had a lot of time at the time that I had a lot of time at the time that I was young , or at least I had a lot of UNK , or two or 30 years ago , there was nothing more than I was going to talk about when I was going to be able to talk about how I was going to go to the first job , and that 's what I wanted to do when I was going to go to the first job and how it was so important .
And if we can give you a little bit of this talk , I hope we all be able to be able to ask ourselves to the success of the success of the success of what we understand and what we understand .
Thank you .
And today 's one thing I want to do .
Don 't say I was a normal man .
And I 'd like to tell you about my two brothers .
This is 22 years old , 22 years old .
He didn 't talk about it , but it 's good for him , but it 's a very good talk .
You know , you know , it 's love .
And he told him what he wanted to share .
He 's not UNK . He doesn 't care .
He was a man of religious faith , and he never talked about UNK .
And when he was singing that we had all of our early UNK , I forgot that I forgot that I had no idea that I had no idea what we had as bad as we know .
This is 16 years old , and it 's time for a long time .
He 's got a UNK memory .
But it 's a choice .
And he couldn 't remember my chocolate , but remember that when I was in the front of my UNK , he had three and a half of my time when he was on my arm .
Sounds amazing ?
But a lot of people don 't think so .
And the fact is that they don 't have a social definition of what they do ; they 're often UNK .
But what 's happened is that if it doesn 't matter if it 's true or the reality , it 's just one of the things , but it 's just one of the things that you know about autism , but it 's very important .
Some of you may not know the word " UNK " UNK , which is the UNK of the UNK of the UNK of the UNK of the human brain , and it 's got to be UNK .
Each one of those cases is special , so it 's different .
And in the world , every 20 minutes , one of the UNK UNK of the population is one of the most fast diseases of the planet , is that we don 't know exactly what it 's going to do with treatment .
And I was looking at the first time , and I thought , " UNK , " one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one of the
When I was three , my brother was born when my brother was very excited , I had a new family .
And after months after months , I realized that he was different .
And he was scared .
He didn 't want to be a UNK like a lot of babies , and he was a very interested in my life .
The UNK UNK in his own world , the UNK of his own UNK , he 's looking for fun , he 's looking at the UNK , he 's looking at the UNK , and he 's looking for a piece of a UNK .
And when he 's growing , he 's much more unique , much more obvious .
And one of the things that UNK with UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK , is that he 's the UNK of UNK , he 's the UNK . He 's a UNK man .
It 's very simple .
And I couldn 't believe that when I was a dog , I wanted them to be a little bit like myself .
But as I turned out of that , I wanted to teach myself what I wanted to teach myself , and I wanted to say something that I wanted to be , I don 't want to use . "
And the normal idea is that the common difference between the differences between the differences of the UNK of human beings is what it 's wrong .
It 's just about UNK .
And I just wanted to say to you , it 's not true that you don 't want to be a normal name for you .
You can be extraordinary .
Whether it 's the difference between UNK us -- we have the ability to be grateful , to be honest , to be the potential , to be the potential .
UNK , progress and change , is what we want to do with other people as others .
Don 't say I 'm normal .
Thank you .
And Dr. UNK , Dr. UNK , who had this crash , was inspired by the UNK of the crash , which led to us all the time , and that 's the last time I had a good time with this picture of time .
But now , 50 years later , we can get a million times , not just in the UNK seconds , or UNK seconds , but in the UNK seconds .
And now I 'm going to show you a new painting of technology , which is called UNK UNK , which is a technology that can detect the movement of light .
So using this technology , we can be able to see the camera in the back of the screen , or we can see the UNK , the camera , the camera that we 've come up with cameras .
Now , if I use a laser a laser , and a couple of seconds -- and then I 'll be able to make a little bit of hydrogen , which is just a few hundred times , like a chicken , like a crash , a crash for a crash and a crash .
Now , what if you put that with a chicken and then you get rid of that bottle , and how does it happen ?
And what 's the light look like that ?
Now , that 's what 's going on .
Now remember , this whole thing is actually the same time -- but now I 'm going to get back a million and a half minutes of what you 're looking at .
But Coke did not invest with that .
Now , there 's something going on here , so let me give you an example .
Now , the light goes into the water , and then we have the teeth , and we get rid of the water , and we get rid of the inside .
And some light goes out , so you start looking at these waves .
Many of the birds eventually ended up and get rid of the UNK .
And you can see , there 's a wall bubbles , right in there .
And as a result , it 's got a desk in front of the table , because you can see the UNK , you 'll see a couple of a couple of a couple of a few .
Now , if you take the normal teeth in a normal way , then it 's like a crash , and you know , you 're going to wait for the last time , and you need to wait for the long time ?
And one day , one week ? Actually , it 's a year .
It 's going to be very boring and UNK at the same time .
But how often do it ?
And you can see the same time you can see the UNK UNK , the background , the walls , the walls .
It 's like a rock in the grass .
And I think that 's how nature of the UNK , a flight that we fly from , but of course what we see is the whole .
But if you 're looking at a little bit like this , you 'll notice , when it 's in the grass , it 's going to be shut down . And it 's not going to end .
Why ? Because it 's in the UNK , it 's in the street UNK seconds .
And so , in the future , when you can go into your cell phone , you can go to the supermarket and you don 't have to be able to go out and find out what 's going on .
So , what did I do with MIT ?
Now , as a photographer , if you want a text , you only have a little light , but we 've got a million times faster than the very short time , so you 've never seen any light .
So what we 've done is we put it back in and over and over and over and over and over and over again , and then it 's a picture that you saw earlier .
And we 've got all sorts of information to go to the point where it 's very interesting .
Now , Democrats .
And some other hero can smell , but one of the things that you can see is that he can see what 's going on .
And the idea is we can put some light into the door .
And that light will go back into the room and go back to the door , and then it 'll come back to the camera , so we can use those light with those light .
It 's not UNK . We really do it .
And on the left , you see what we call our UNK screen camera .
And on the wall there 's a human model model that we 're going to do in the same direction .
And so , in our paintings , it was written to natural UNK , and then they created this animation .
And we 're going to go through the wall , and they 're going to die , and it 's going to be clear that we 're going to be able to get the lights down , but some of the stuff , when it 's going back to the surface , but the most interesting thing is , they 're going back in a slightly different period of time , but the most interesting thing is , they 're going to be looking at a very different period of time , but the most interesting thing is , they 're going to be looking at a very different period of time in the camera , but the most interesting thing is , they 'll be in a very different period of time in the camera , but the most interesting thing is , they 'll be in a very different period of time in the camera , but the most interesting thing is , they 'll be in a very different period of time in the camera , but the most interesting thing is , they 'll be in a very different period of time in the back of
And because we have a UNK camera that we can do , and then we fly back seconds , and then the camera has something very different .
It 's got a good time of time , and it can be UNK through the speed of light .
So we don 't only know about the camera , but we know the distance , but we don 't know what 's going on .
And as we can see here , it 's a beautiful picture that you see in the screen , as you can see , but then we have a lot of photos , a lot of things , and then we can see what 's going on , is we going to see the invisible thing ?
Can we measure a UNK ?
This is our model . This is what we do .
So right now , we 'll be able to walk in the world , but in the future , we can get rid of the world , because they 're able to go through the UNK , because we can see the UNK in the window , or we can be able to see the UNK , or we can build the heart of the body , or we can go to the heart of the heart , and we can even see the heart of your heart and see the heart of your body .
But of course , since groups and blood vessels , it 's very difficult to us , so we asked people to really believe that what we need to do with this technology is that we 've got a new set of problems in the next generation of time for the next generation of time .
Now , one of the things that we 've been working with UNK is that , science and science of science , and I realize that every time we get into science is not only the science of science , it 's a new set of computing , which we 've come from now , is a very small computer , a very small , very UNK , and we 're looking at the speed of time , at the time , that these waves are just a few UNK seconds .
But something interesting things happen .
And when you see these UNK lines , they 're moving away from us .
But these waves should be moving .
What happened ?
And the result is , because we 're looking at the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed , we have these strange words , and Einstein is very happy looking at these images .
And what happens in the camera is that when it 's hit in the camera , it 's going to be clear as a result of time between time and space .
So whether it 's possible , or for the next generation , we 've got a lot of data and a lot of data , and we hope it all the time , and we hope it , that we can tell the difference where we don 't know , but we don 't need to be more like the UNK of the UNK .
It 's time . Thank you .
This is the place where I live , Kenya , in Kenya .
And on my side of my father , he was a UNK in UNK Park .
We don 't have a lot of UNK in the United States here , and that means that it 's UNK like a UNK animal like the UNK in the park in the park .
So that 's the kind of thing that goes out of the lion and then that 's what they do .
And they killed a UNK .
And that was when I was killed with my shoulder in the morning , and it was killed , and my mind had been killed , because it was my house in my house .
We think we have people who believe in our bodies and family come from heaven and then , as well as we do .
And so I grew up with a lot of time .
And we had a man who was protecting them with their family and our UNK , but they had a bad job , and they were always depressed .
And so they decided to kill these lions .
This is one of the six lions in the United States of the National Park .
And I think it 's the UNK reason for UNK Park .
And in our family , there were six and nine boys who had the mother of UNK and the same thing that had happened to me .
So I had to find a way to solve a solution .
And one of the first things I thought was to use fire , because I know that lions are scared .
But I also realized that there was no consequence , and there was the fact that the lions saw the dead .
But I 'm not going to give that , I 'll be grateful .
And there 's the second solution : UNK UNK .
And I wanted to pretend that I wanted to be UNK the lion so that I was standing on my UNK .
But lions are smart .
And when they saw the first day , they went back , but the next day , they 'll come back and say , " That 's never going on here , and he 's always there .
And so they cried , and killed the animals .
And one night , I took a UNK in my UNK , and the night was not going to go back .
And I started to realize that lions have been afraid to move .
And so I had a thought .
And because I was a young man , I was able to be able to leave a day in my house , and one day I even lost my mom in my house , and I learned a lot about UNK knowledge .
And so I found a old man with a UNK , which is a little bit from a UNK device that controls the UNK of a UNK in which to control the light from the back of the UNK , to allow the light back to the light .
And as I found a switch , we can control the lights of light .
The light bulb comes from a UNK suit .
Everything is ready .
And as you can see , it 's made of solar power back to the battery , and then it 's made for energy -- I call it the " UNK , " it 's called " UNK . "
And that leads to the light , the light , the light .
And you can see , it 's a UNK UNK , because it 's from Texas .
And that 's what it looked like when the birds were looking like .
And that light line , that light UNK will be UNK , is that I was walking away from my bed , but in fact , I was in my bed where I was in my bed .
Thank you .
And I had this device in two years ago when I was in my house , and we had not had the UNK of a lion with a UNK .
And my neighbor had heard that .
One of them is the grandmother .
And then there was a whole bunch of UNK that was killed by the UNK , and she asked whether she was able to help her in the house that she had a light in the house .
And I was just going to agree with that .
And as I get these lights , you can see that it 's a UNK light .
And now I 've been seven cents home in my family community , with a UNK in the UNK .
Now , my approach now is that all of you in Kenya have been UNK from all over other UNK animals , like a UNK , a UNK and a half of us , as they 're used to be used to be used by the UNK of the wild of the planet .
And I was lucky because it had been the most successful school in Kenya , the best school in Kenya , and I was grateful for it .
And so my new school now is to join , and to help me be more money and to raise more money .
And I 'm going to take my friends back to my community , helping them , and I teach them how to build a UNK in the UNK .
And one year ago , I was a very UNK boy who had spent my dad , and I was looking back in the back , and I was going to be there , and I would be there .
Today , I do .
And I got the opportunity to TED , which was my first time .
And so my great dream is , when I grow , I grew up a plane engineer and a pilot .
And I had a UNK , but now it was my invention , and my dad saved my dad , and he was able to do the same thing .
Thank you very much .
Chris , you don 't believe , listen of what you are doing .
So you 've got this poll . Richard UNK : Yes .
Is that what you 're doing here ?
What 's next for you ?
And one of the things I was , I wanted to do a UNK horse .
UNK : I know that power is already , but I just wanted to do it myself .
You 've tried something , right ? You know , I had tried that , but I stopped . I had to get it out .
You 're a UNK . Richard UNK , you 're different .
We 're going to be able to meet each of you in this room , every time you get into it .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
I lived in Los Angeles in Los Angeles .
This is Los Angeles : UNK , UNK , UNK land .
And so the idea of the city , they sit up and talk to the name of Los Angeles , and so they made it back to the South Los Angeles , as it 's going to be the issue of the city 's real .
This is a South Los Angeles .
The UNK , the UNK , the land .
And as the American of the United States , I was living in a food in my life , and then it 's got to go back to a place where people don 't have the money , they don 't have to be able to get rid of service and cars .
And the interesting thing is , is that it 's going to be more .
In Los Angeles , people died alone .
For instance , my UNK in my neighborhood is 10 times bigger than the UNK of the UNK , maybe eight times as eight times than we have .
And I was tired of all the time .
And as I think of it , if you don 't have to get healthy food , if you 're in your household , what happens when you get from your community , what you are in your health system , what are you ?
And I saw a UNK like a UNK car .
And I saw UNK UNK like UNK .
And I wanted to get it out .
And I think that the answer is there .
The food is , food is a solution .
And then I was angry , and I was tired of UNK , and I had a UNK call .
So what I did was I was working on my house when I was in my house .
It 's what we call the UNK of the park .
150 feet away 10 feet wide .
The government was there .
But there 's always demand .
And so I thought , " This is my responsibility , I have to adapt it , and so I wanted to do it . "
And that 's why I 'm going to maintain it .
So my team and my team , our UNK , we started growing up the land of their own food forest , and there 's nine and a half of them .
We 're a free organization , which is the UNK of UNK , which is all volunteers , and what we do with it .
The garden was beautiful .
But it was very quick .
And the government was asked to me , gave me the UNK , and then I had to get back to my garden , and then I had to turn it into a UNK .
I was like , " What 's going on ?
Does it ever care about a lot of food on a small land ?
And then I thought , " Well , " right ? "
Because it didn 't happen .
So there was a student that was published in Los Angeles , and one of the members of the name came back and the UNK , and then there was a sign of UNK , and there was a UNK , and there was a UNK .
We use it in our hands .
And then also came back to visit and talked about what he had meant and love what we do .
I mean , of course , how can they do that ?
This is the size of UNK in Los Angeles , in the United States of Los Angeles .
It has 26 million square kilometers .
That 's 20 central park .
And there 's enough space coming into the UNK of UNK .
Why ?
A tree can get a thousand , even 10,000 a thousand .
A single dollar 's green can get 75 of you with 75 million dollars .
This is my belief , and I told people , grow your own food .
It 's as though as a food of food .
But now , in Los Angeles I had a threat .
And I grew up there to be my son here .
I was no part of something that I was able to create myself with other people that I created myself .
And I saw it . I was a artist .
The UNK job was my paintings , and I was able to create art .
It 's like the UNK artist , the wall , the UNK , the UNK .
I took the garden and the land , and the plants and the trees were just my UNK .
You may be surprised what you 're going to see if you think of it as you know .
You can 't imagine how amazing you are , and how it 's going on .
And what happened ?
And I saw my garden into a UNK tool , which became the tool of my community .
In order to change the community , you have to change the existence of the soil .
We are all the soil .
You 'll be surprised by your kids .
The UNK activity is the best part of the body and the most important activity in the middle of the city .
And you can get UNK again again .
And as I remember , a mother and a daughter in the morning of night , when I came to see them , they seem to be very upset .
And they made me feel bad , and I told them , you don 't need food like this .
This is the UNK reason in the streets .
And when I saw that I was hungry and I was feeling that , I thought , I 'd be sure that I had a lot of money , and people ask me , " What do you believe for you ? "
And I said , " Of course , I 'm sure it 's going to be UNK .
And that 's why it 's in the streets .
And that 's what I wanted .
And I wanted to leave it , but at the same time , I wish people would be healthy . "
And when I was a man who was a prison in Jerusalem , he was a garden in a garden .
And these guys helped me UNK .
And that 's how cool they 've shared about how they make their mother and their mother and their grandmother , and see that it can change their own lives , just by looking at the moment , right in this moment .
And the green tissue is probably about 20 garden .
We 've got about 50 people working on our team , and they are volunteers .
And if the kids grow into UNK , they will be able to eat a UNK .
And if they grow , they 'll eat .
But when these aren 't the kids , if they don 't have any of the time it 's going to be the same idea of the body and the body , they 're just wearing the food that 's just in front of them .
And I saw young people who wanted to work , but they were very happy that I saw different colors , and then they had been working on their way to design their way for them , and then the path was UNK .
And when it happened on the ground , I found a chance that we could train these kids in their communities , and there 's a living life .
And when we do that , guess what ?
Next is George Washington .
But if we don 't change the surface of the soil , we never do that .
This led me to be here , and that 's what I wanted to do .
And I wanted to get a UNK in this neighborhood where people could share food .
And I wanted to turn it into a healthy dog .
Don 't be wrong .
I don 't want to be free . You don 't need to be free .
And the funny thing about sustainability is that you have to maintain it .
I mean , I mean , I 'm going to be working with kids to get their lives away from the streets and let them know that they 're living in their food and be good and open and open .
So what I wanted to do was I wanted to try to figure out what I wanted to do with this plan .
I wanted to be the UNK of the environmental revolution , the UNK , the UNK .
We 're going to have a UNK definition .
If you 're not a UNK , then you 're not a UNK .
What happens when you get a UNK ?
It 's going to be a UNK that you choose to be .
And basically , if you want to see me , if I wanted to meet you , if I wanted to sit in my hand chair , I call it to my name .
And if you wanted to see me , I 'd like to get a little bit like that , if we wanted to go to the garden .
And that 's it . Thanks !
Thank you .
And in September of 2011 , I was a UNK and a UNK of New York .
We are UNK , UNK .
We 've been in a black hole with a black and a UNK , and a main part of it is to be able to get rid of the sun , the main part of the planet is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
And we can control things that are more UNK , that we have been UNK in the world , but we 're actually interested in the media , and we 've been interested in good images and a lot of good pictures of images and photos .
And 2011 , as a global man , as I saw in my house looking at the tragedy of Japan .
And after a long time , one of the organization that I was working on , I was working on a team called UNK , just after a few days in the local world .
And one of the things that I was working with my UNK was that we couldn 't wait for home , so I decided to add them in and try to get three weeks to do it for three weeks .
In May , I went to Japan to Japan .
And that 's a small farmer in Japan , and one of the population is about 50,000 and a half years .
And at the end of that time , there was a very high time of UNK in the back of 24 meters when it was two miles away .
You can imagine , it 's a very bad town .
We are the UNK in the middle of the UNK .
We 're helping schools and UNK and UNK and UNK .
We had a lot of UNK , UNK UNK , the fish that were there in the local factory , UNK fish .
And we 're also UNK , but we 're very good at all of us .
A couple of weeks ago all volunteers and local communities , find out something like this .
They 've found pictures of photos and UNK and cameras and UNK .
It 's the same response and the action .
They take them all the time , and then put them back together .
And now , when I was aware of that , there was a huge part of these men .
And when they do that , you know , it 's UNK , it 's UNK , it 's UNK , it 's UNK .
And I was on the last week in Japan , and I found myself in a UNK center .
And you can help a UNK by UNK UNK .
And it turns out that there is thousands of people working on the local UNK center .
And when people were going to collect the pictures of the UNK , I was fortunate enough to get their trust , and then I began to leave them .
And one of the things that I 've heard about that moment is that I 've been listening to people , and I 've been listening to say , " You 've got to be creative , and I really really do that . "
And when I was looking for a long time , there was still a lot of UNK , or something that I could help with , I could help them , and I know a lot of people who can help them with these pictures .
So , in the morning , I came back to Facebook and asked a couple of these things , and I had a lot of UNK news , and I thought they wanted to help , and I knew we should do it .
And then we 've started creating something like that .
This is the last time to try that .
And it 's not very impressive , but it 's UNK in the water where it 's UNK , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we have to do it , and we 've got to be very accurate .
Otherwise , the UNK face is not going to look like her face -- it 's tragic , and it 's just the same thing .
And as we go back in time , we need to have more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than five days , and one of the women who were working with them would be willing to help , they come to help and they come from 12 different countries .
And two weeks after that , I got about 150 volunteers who were willing to join us into the UNK .
And on the end of that time , just in Japan , we 've created a lot of UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK in UNK .
And we had a UNK device in the last week , and people came up with these UNK and UNK them back to their photos .
And sometimes , when there are some older women coming from the scanner , they find the photos , and then they get them back , they 're going to be UNK , and they may be UNK over the other end of the planet , and at the same time , it 's going to be used by the other end of the planet , and it 's starting to be used in the other end of the planet .
And then at the time , when they had time to get their time back , it was different . And of course , it was different .
And then you 'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a few weeks , maybe a few weeks .
And even a few months .
And the beauty of this picture is used to be UNK from your hands , or when you get the color , you get it out , you get a little bit of what 's going on inside of the water .
It 's a very high process .
And all of these things that are affected by the West , in the water , sometimes in the trash , sometimes at the end of the boat , all of this is going to be a big part of this project , so it 's a major part of the project .
And if these pictures aren 't going to be clean , we can 't do that , we 've got to do it , we have to do it , we 've got to get it down .
Our approach is very cool , as we can do .
There was a woman who was taken back and forth .
And it 's very easy to get back again .
And it was like my UNK , as it was before .
You can 't have any UNK , you can have a UNK .
And that gave us a very lucky woman to be lucky .
And then she started himself , and until she realized that she had a UNK effect for a long time .
Okay , so she 's got a look at her face .
And , in fact , one of the things that she had with her face was completely UNK , and we were able to be able to combine all of these elements into a good picture and then create it .
And when she got over here , she talked to us about the story of a few photos .
And her -- she 's actually discovered by her husband , when you find a UNK in the local UNK of the UNK in the local UNK system , where it 's really clear for him .
And on the end of the tsunami , he 's making sure that the tsunami is going off at the end of the UNK .
And as soon as it was , he had to get out of the tsunami .
She had two sons , and many of them had a little different school , a UNK school .
One of the kids in the school had been found by the tsunami .
And then she spent a couple of weeks of UNK , and they had a very UNK man .
And we gave her a picture of the day , and that was the last birthday birthday .
And for her , although the UNK of the gods and the UNK of his son , the photos of him gave him the best of his son , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK that he had died , is that it was destroyed , or that he had been destroyed .
In Japan , six months after Japan , " UNK and UNK , " and hundreds of thousands of things for a lot of time , a lot of times -- a lot of -- a lot of -- a lot of -- a lot of -- is , most of the time .
And most of those things are back back . And that 's very important .
There are more than 500 volunteers in the world , and we 've been UNK over the last couple of these pictures , all of these pictures .
In this period we don 't have to be able to get a thousand dollars in the process , and most of the printer is going to be done in the printer .
And we 've been looking for a long time .
And here 's a picture of one of the things that we have as important and so forth , some of us , is something that we have , as opposed to something , about what it is , and one of the things that we hear about it , and one of the things that we hear about it , is that it 's a love of what 's going on and on and on and on and on and on .
And they help us record and UNK our past and our past and our time as a result of what 's expected to us , but sometimes it 's time for a moment when it comes back .
And that 's what the project is , the small thing for the human brain , the UNK of the human mind , the UNK of the past .
And when it comes back to the front of the guys , it 's going to be a lot of a lot of difference between the lives of UNK and UNK .
And this is the project that we 've created as a result of these things .
For some of these things , it was built to a certain kind of relationship , which was built to some of the things that came back to the UNK society , which was the ability to give them a sense of UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ,
And I wanted to leave you with a video , and I got a letter from UNK , and then I got home from Japan .
And when I was in my photo , I wanted to be the story of all of those stories and pictures in the photo .
And one of the women , when I was a little girl , a little girl , a little baby , a little baby , a little girl , my grandmother , my grandmother , my mother , is going to be born with my grandmother and my mother and I was just born in my house .
When we go to the planet , we have the most basic need to be , not ? "
Thank you .
Now , today , I want to talk about a UNK question , which is the same answer .
And I 'm going to say that the secret of violence , and what I 'm going to answer is that all of you have been asked : " Why is it going to be ? "
" How many of you would be willing to live with her man ? "
I 'm not a lawyer , a society , a politician , a politician .
I was a woman who had to tell a story .
I was 11 years old when I was 22 years old .
And I moved in New York and I started my first job as a UNK UNK at UNK .
And I had the first card . I had a very big secret .
And that was the secret that I was when I was a man in my soul , with a UNK , a lot of times , a lot of time , a lot of time ago .
And this was my favorite man , to my tongue , to kill me , I had been hearing what I was doing .
And now the story that I 'm talking about , which is a mental UNK , a UNK UNK , a UNK UNK , or even a million women die .
And maybe it 's happening right now .
I think it 's not like a typical family .
I 've had the English UNK in the Harvard Institute of Harvard 's Law in the UNK of UNK .
And I was most of the time in which most of the time I was working with a company called UNK , UNK and Washington .
And I was asked my second and a half and a half of my children .
And I had a black UNK , a UNK UNK , my UNK .
And that 's the first thing I want to tell you , which is : obesity may happen when you don 't want to be any of you , of yourself , or education and education .
It 's everywhere .
The second thing I want to say is that many of you believe that the women in women are the women 's own women .
No .
More than 60 percent of the deaths of UNK are the men , the UNK , the UNK , which is the most important thing that we don 't want to see , and that 's one of the UNK .
And I was thinking that one of the things that I wanted to stay in the world is that I 'm going to continue to leave a man in a UNK man , but actually , it 's very common for me .
And when I was 22 , and in the United States in the United States , 16 women had two times more likely to die than the other woman or girls , that were killed in the United States and had killed with six women or girls .
I was a very typical victim , because I had the UNK and UNK .
And I met a UNK in a UNK , and then was 16 , and then it was cold .
And we were sitting in New York , and he talked to me .
And he told me two things .
And the first one is he graduated from the UNK UNK school , and there was a very good mall .
But first of the first time I was going to leave you with one of the most profound ideas of what he had to do with his UNK and humor , his UNK look like a farm family .
His UNK , like the UNK , is UNK UNK .
And one of the smartest things that I was working with was the UNK of UNK UNK , which is one of the reasons why I was , I was a big man in this emotion .
And at the beginning of the beginning , he made me think that he was a UNK hero .
And we started talking about what I wanted to say , for my smart , my job at Harvard , when I was a student in Harvard and I was working with my job .
And he wanted to know my family , my childhood , my childhood , my dream .
And Dr. UNK was one of the things that I was working with , and I had never been there yet for a woman .
And he told me , when he started working with his secrets , he told me , he started working with his UNK , he had been working on his UNK , he had been UNK , and he had to go for a long time when he was 15 years old , who had to be in the third grade of his life when he had to be in the third grade .
And that 's why the UNK of the University of UNK , the UNK of the Wall Street and the UNK of the sky , is going to be significant for him .
And if there was something that I would say that I had to say that I had to say that I had to say that I had to say , I had to say , I wanted to be the same man , I was able to get my husband , I was able to be the same man , I had a lot of what I was going to do , and then I was able to get there , because I couldn 't see a lot of violence in the UNK or whatever I had , because I didn 't see a lot of violence in my UNK or anger or anger or anger .
And I didn 't know that it was the first step of UNK and UNK .
And I didn 't know that the second step was isolated .
You know , when I go back to the stage , but we 're going to go back to the stage , but we 're going to get you down here , and then I 'm going to leave you with your house , and I 'm going to leave you with your apartment , and I 'm going to leave you to leave out of your friends and the UNK and the city of your friends , and I 'll leave you to see that there was a lot of friends and family and colleagues of your friends .
And the fact that he told me that when he was in a Friday night , he told me that he had no job , and his wife , and he said , because he had to quit the city , and he had to leave his city , and he had to leave the city , and that he had to leave the city , the UNK family , the UNK family of the New York and the UNK and the UNK that I was working in New York City and I was working with a lot of life and a lot of living in New York City .
And at that time , I wanted to leave the New York and I wanted to get my job , and I wanted to make sure that I wanted to be married , and then I agreed , and I had to quit the job , and I had to quit , and I had to quit the job , and I had to leave the job and I wanted to leave the studio .
And I thought I had a crazy love , and I had no idea that I had been a UNK in my body , my body , your body and the economy .
And the third stage of violence is the beginning of violence , and looking at her response .
This is the sound of the dog .
And we just moved to New York City -- I think it 's very safe -- he bought three UNK .
And then it 's in your car 's mouth .
And then there was the UNK in my bed , and the third thing had to be put on the floor .
He said that when he said that there was a man who had given him to get these guns .
Let 's leave him to be secure .
And the gun was a obvious signal for me , although he didn 't take a gun , I had UNK UNK at the time .
It was the first time when it was five days ago .
And that 's the morning that morning , and I 'm wearing a UNK .
And as I was working on computer , I wanted to work on the UNK of the computer , and when I was a little bit of that , I had some anger of anger , my UNK , my UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , my left , my neck , the left one that I had on my neck before I was in the front of my neck .
Five days after five days after my mother , I was in my mom 's seat , and I was asked him .
And even though what happened , I still believe that we could be happy life , because we 're so proud of love .
And that 's exactly what he 's doing with .
And he was just working too far , and when my family came to my family and my family , I was asked him to be grateful .
This is an accident , and then he won 't hurt me again again .
And I was then two times time when I was then .
And the first time when I was driving to find the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret , he was so UNK that I had to get rid of my head of UNK and UNK .
And a few days before , a UNK car drove back home back home in my face , he had a very heavy UNK in my face .
When two and a half years after I had been two years , I was able to get twice two times a year .
And I used to be one of those people .
In fact , every three American women have a UNK goal , and the UNK of UNK has been killed by 15 million children .
So in fact , I 'm not a UNK .
Go back to my question : Why are I going on ?
And the answer is very simple .
I didn 't know that he was .
And even though he had to come from the head of UNK , to my dog , to be killed by my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , my UNK , I never had ever been a wife , I never had ever been a wife in my head , and I never had ever been a wife in my own prison .
And as a result , I was a very confident woman , and I was the only man in the world who was able to help out what was going on .
The other question I wanted to ask you , why is she going to leave ?
Why not ? I have a lot of opportunities .
And for me , it 's the best thing that people ask me , and that 's the right thing , you can 't understand it , but only a lot of what it 's like to be bad for you .
Because the last step in a violent violence was to kill her .
More than 80 percent of the women who died in the UNK , after she left , because it had UNK .
Some of the things that had happened in the course of the long time , when they were UNK , they were the UNK of the family and the kids , and the kids are willing to get their parents working on the side of their parents , and the child would be working with them with their parents ' lives .
And now we still ask , why don 't you ?
And the reason I decided to leave , because it was the last time I was going to be able to get the right I could ever get .
And I realized that if I was not fighting , this man would kill me .
So I broke the silence .
And I was asked to you , the police , the neighbors , my friends and my family , and I was standing here , because you 've helped me help me .
We tend to express the victims of the UNK and the UNK of the news .
" Why is she going to leave ? "
And the young man was saying , " This is the UNK of her body , as it is the UNK and UNK .
But one of the UNK of the book , many men and women had told me that their stories , they began to tell people that they had come from , they came from a long time when they came from , that is a good life -- as employees and wife and mothers , as I was living , I was living in a lot of life and a parent and a mother , as I was living and I was living in a life of life and a woman and a mother and a mother , as I was living and I had a life of life and a woman .
In fact , I 'm a typical family and a very classic parent .
And then I was married with a UNK man , and we had three kids .
And I had a black UNK , a UNK UNK , my UNK .
And I would never have been a UNK , as a UNK , to be my head , to be my mind , to be my mind .
Now , you may be wondering , wow , that 's amazing , or , " but in the process , I 'm talking about you .
And I would be sure that most of you in my talk now had been killed or killed in the morning or when you were .
And that 's what you 're going to happen to you , when you 're in your daughter and you 're the best friend of all .
I was able to end up with a crazy love of what I call the " story . "
Today I 'm still going to be quiet .
And that 's what I 've been able to help with other victims , and I 've been grateful for you .
Tell me what you 've heard today .
UNK is alive in silence .
You 've got to be able to be able to be able to be able to close your families to be able to light .
And we need all of our victims .
We need you to understand the secret of violence .
And your kids , your colleagues , your friends and your family talk about this topic and bring it into a light .
It helps to improve the good and enjoy the future , to the future , to the future .
And it turns out that violence is going to be UNK and UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK .
And let 's see , let 's go , our bed and our families are becoming safe and peaceful .
Thank you .
When I was a kid , I thought that my country was the best thing in the world , and I had a song that was called " UNK . "
And I think it 's very proud .
In my school , we 've got a lot of time thinking about the history of time , but we 've never seen a lot of time in the same way that you know that in the same or Japan and Japan are the enemy .
And even though I 've been talking about outside the world , I think I would have been in my lifetime since I had all of my life .
When I was seven years old , my first time at the first time was a very first time , I think I was normal in my life .
My family wasn 't poor . And as I had , I 've never experienced my suffering in my own life .
But at the end of the year , my mother brought a letter from her brother from her colleagues .
And that told me , when you read this letter , it 's five and a half of them , because we 've lost two weeks in two weeks .
And we 're standing on the floor , and we 're hungry . "
And I was shocked .
That was the first time I heard about living in my country .
And after that time , when I walked a train , I saw a very sad thing to get me out .
And the woman 's woman is lying in the ground , and the child gets a little baby , and the child is UNK with his mother 's face .
But no one of them help them , because you can 't help yourself with your family .
And it happened in the ' 80s .
And unfortunately , over a million and a million lions are killed in prison , and there are many of the drugs that are eating by the UNK and the UNK and the UNK .
And it 's going to be more UNK , and all of the rest of the night is dark , except for Chinese UNK , with the UNK of the home in my house .
And I wondered why they 've got a UNK and we don 't have it .
This is a map of a satellite from the North and the UNK of the night .
This is the UNK , which is part of China and North America .
And as you can see , there 's something very different about this river , UNK in the middle of North America .
But a lot of people died .
And sometimes I saw my body in UNK .
And I couldn 't get too far as much as I left North Korea , but I was told that it was in the most difficult couple of years I had been living and I was working with .
And I thought , I was very happy with my family .
But I never thought of about 14 and a half years ago .
In China , I was a little girl with a very small girl .
And I don 't know that in the same time where I was a UNK , and I was excited to realize that it 's not only that it 's going to be bad and even worse .
And so I was living in fear , and I was scared of my identity , and I was going to get back to North Korea , to get the fate of the tragedy .
And one day , one of the worst things I had was , I was in China , and I was asked by the Chinese police to go to the police .
And one of the guys that I was on the street , so the police test my UNK ability , and I asked a lot of questions .
And I was feeling that my mind was going to be UNK and UNK .
And if there was any case , I would go back and get back .
And I thought I 'd been working in my life , and I still saw my fear and my fear , and I was asking them .
And then one of the police said , " You know , it 's wrong . "
She 's not North Carolina . "
And then they took me off . It was a miracle .
And there are some lions in China where they 're going to go to the UNK in China , but there are many of them who were asked by the Chinese police , who was sent to the North Korea .
These girls were lucky .
And even though they were caught , but they were released from a very large international UNK , and they finally ended up .
But there are other states that are lucky .
Every year in the Gulf of the year , 75 percent of the streets were killed in China , back from North Korea , when they were killed , had been killed or UNK .
And even though I was lucky enough to leave North Korea , my lot of my suffering did not be good .
It 's a very tragic fact that it 's going to be UNK and that 's hard to survive .
And even though they learned Chinese , they found a job , and their entire world would be UNK in the world .
And that 's why , in the last 10 years , I decided to go to Korea , and then I started a new life .
It 's a lot harder difficult to be a lot harder than my imagination .
The English is very important , so I had to start learning the third of the third language -- English .
And also , I realized that there was a huge difference between Korea and North Korea .
And despite all of us , it 's very different , but we have a very different species of UNK .
I even experienced a question of identity .
I was a UNK or a North ?
Where are I ? Who are you ?
And suddenly , I couldn 't be proud of my country as a nation .
And although it 's not something you do with Korea , it 's not going to be a lot of good , but I decided it .
ready to go to college .
And just as I started working on a lot of time , I got a very amazing call .
And the same government decided that when I was to go home with my family , just as a man , my family would be forced to go and moved to the UNK area where it was .
They had to get out , so I began to help them .
The wind in the North States is so UNK .
And to think of all of you who 's in North Korea and Korea , it 's very ironic , is that I sat in China and then go to the border .
Because my family doesn 't , so I was going to help them go over 50 kilometers across the country , go from Asia .
And we had a week in the back of the bus , a few thousand days ago .
And once again , we sat down on a bus , a Chinese doctor .
He 's looking at everybody 's UNK and start UNK .
Because my family don 't understand Chinese , I fear they 're going to be cut .
And so when the Chinese judge was in my house , I was telling him the number of things that I was talking about , and then I was a UNK .
And he looked at me , but luckily , he did .
And so we went to UNK , but I had always been able to cut all the way back to the UNK police police .
And even though we 've had that , my family and I was in jail .
And after a while , when I had the money , my family , when I had the money , my family , when I had the money , I was released for a month , and then , at the end of the age of UNK , he was caught up .
That was one of the UNK moments of my life .
I was able to get my family into freedom , and when I was there , my family had a good day , and then the prison is not far from North America .
And I had a lot of time for UNK and police , and I had a lot of UNK from my UNK , and I had not had enough money to put it , but I had enough money to go and pay a good job .
And I love a lot .
And then I heard somebody asked me , " What ?
And I was a UNK , a complete stranger , and I wanted to ask .
And I had the same thing that I was using on the English and the other man , and that guy was going to go to the UNK , and there was the cost of my family and a half of my family and a half of them .
And I was grateful , and asked , " Why are you going to help me ? "
" I 'm not helping you , " he said .
" I was helping all the time . "
And I realized that that was one of the things that my life was in my life .
And that 's the good thing that I wanted to say was that I had a hope that was the most important wish that I had learned that I had the hope that strangers was the same thing that we needed to be on the UNK and the UNK of the North and the UNK of the North world .
And eventually , after a very long time , my family and my family , at the same time , was only half of the war .
Many streets and their families , and when they come to the new country , they usually don 't have a lot of money , or UNK .
And so we can help education , English training , job training , job .
We can also be able to be the UNK of the world , because we have many of us who live in the streets in North Korea , and we 're talking about the information and money of the UNK and the rest of the animals .
And I was fortunate that , in my life , there was a lot of help , and so I wanted to help the dream that dream of God 's dream is going to be a dream .
And I 'm confident that you 're going to see a lot of UNK in the stage right now , including the stage here .
Thank you .
And you may be wondering that something is good .
It 's a UNK material , which is a very good material , which is driving right now , but not always like today , when it 's time .
It 's very UNK in the UNK .
And it 's very good if you 're riding a bike and a lot of your car , not good .
And at the same time , it 's going to be a lot of noise .
And it 's a little bit like this material , if we 're going to UNK the city where we 're going to build cities , like the Netherlands in the Netherlands , we 'd like to do a little bit of noise , a little bit of noise .
And the way it works is to get UNK UNK .
The UNK UNK in the Netherlands , in the Netherlands , has a little bit of UNK with the water in the past , and the oil will come back , and the road drive off .
And the noise disappears .
Because it 's got a lot of stuff , it 's very quiet and it 's quiet .
And of course , it 's the same thing , the UNK of this path may be UNK .
What 's cool ? Look at this UNK rock here .
And then it 's going , and then a couple of them , more and more , more -- I 'm not going to show up .
But they 're going to hurt your UNK glass and you 're not happy .
And finally , it 's going to take a lot of damage .
And sometimes it 's going to be UNK .
Ah , he 's first .
UNK , of course , but we have a solution .
And what you see here is the damage .
This is a UNK , as I said , a very small UNK in a rock .
And because of UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , is the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , is going to be able to get a little UNK and a little bit of a UNK , a little bit of a UNK .
And if you drive in this road , you 'll take these UNK and we see ourselves .
In order to solve that , we thought about the UNK .
And if we can make this material , we can have a solution .
And what we 're using is the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , which we call these little UNK UNK .
So now there 's a few UNK right now right now in there .
You need a machine like this , a UNK motor -- that can be used to cook .
It can be UNK . It 's very good at UNK .
So what we 're going to do is , we 're going to do it with a UNK , and we have a UNK in the UNK , and then you get rid of those little UNK and the UNK UNK are UNK .
And because it 's too big to do that , I 'm going to show you a little bit about what I 'm looking at here .
It 's the same thing as a UNK mechanism .
And then I put it in there , and now it 's what it looks like .
This is what the sample looks like today .
And we have UNK machines in our lab .
And we 've tested a lot of monkeys , and the government looked at us , and they said , " This is interesting . We should try . "
The government gave us a long story , and we 've done a lot of the time at the end of the UNK in the back of the planet .
And that 's what we do . You 're looking for a lot of these things , and that 's bad in a couple of years , and we 've figured it up .
And we 've spent a lot of samples in the lab doing a lot of tests in the lab .
And we 've done a lot of time , and we added a lot of antibiotics , using them with our UNK , UNK and testing .
And we can go back further .
And it turns out that this experiment , if we 're in the back of this road , is the UNK , we 're going to move this machine into the back of the road -- we 're going to be able to save a lot of money on the planet , but we 're going to save a lot of money on the planet .
And so it turns out that we 've created a material that 's created with a UNK , which is a UNK increase in the UNK of the UNK and the UNK so that you can save a lot of money in the future .
You wonder whether it 's going to work .
And we can see this sample here . Now a little bit about a little bit .
In fact , I 'm going to drive it up and I can show you that it 's possible .
But try to try that .
See , it 's cool .
Thank you .
And I wanted to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
There are 10,000 birds in the planet .
UNK is one of the most UNK part of the most extinct .
And when you see UNK as one thing , the first thing that you find in your mind is something that 's kind of UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK .
And I wanted to change this thought , and I wanted to change the feelings of UNK , because they need our compassion , they really need .
Let me tell you why .
First , why are they going to leave us ?
Charles Darwin had recognized that in the back of the back of the Atlantic in the back of the back of the Atlantic , he was saying that , " UNK , UNK birds are always UNK UNK with UNK UNK . "
You don 't have to find that much worse than this , but Charles Darwin said .
You know , Darwin came back to the U.K. , and I 'll tell you why .
The UNK UNK were UNK -- it was UNK , as a UNK dog , as a UNK .
And recently , if you 've noticed the news of Kenya in Kenya -- Kenya , UNK , is the UNK of UNK , but I wanted to get it down .
I 'm going to ask it . You know why ?
Because Congress can 't keep the natural waste clean .
It cannot stop the disease .
It 's almost UNK .
They 're far away from extinct .
And then , one of my favorite , UNK and UNK .
There are two great UNK in the world .
And the UNK of UNK in the United States , as part of the UNK and the UNK of the other century , is that there are 16 UNK .
So why is this important ? Well , one of the things that are important about the ecosystem as well as a function of ecosystems , they UNK the environment .
UNK is our natural UNK UNK .
And then they call it the UNK of their bodies to eat their bodies .
They could kill all of their bodies , and they can break off the UNK of the virus and the UNK of the virus to the UNK and the disease .
And one of the things that you 've seen is that there are three times more likely to die in the region , and there are three times more and more opportunities than the UNK of the disease .
It 's a lot of history , a lot of history .
They 're related to the UNK culture .
The UNK of UNK is the UNK of the UNK and UNK UNK , UNK UNK and UNK UNK , UNK UNK and UNK UNK .
And in the UNK , UNK UNK of UNK , he had the UNK and UNK of his life with the UNK UNK of the UNK .
And there was something very important about the UNK of Tibet , which was there in the Gulf of Tibet , because there were nothing left there , so that there was no UNK in the community so that there 's a natural body of nature .
So where are the problems ?
Kenya is growing up in Kenya , and six is extinct .
Many of the UNK , the UNK of UNK , is that the human being UNK of the UNK of the UNK of the living and the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK .
In South Asia , there are some of these countries in Asia and Pakistan , which means that they 're going to die in 10 or 15 or 15 years , because the UNK are killed by the UNK of the UNK .
Now , there 's UNK UNK in India , India , in India , in India , in India .
Because the UNK UNK , the UNK UNK , is the UNK between the UNK and the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the number one percent of the population in India is what 's happening in India , and it 's the number of growth in India that 's happening in India .
Kenya is going to be the largest wind of UNK in Africa : UNK UNK is going to be made in the UNK of UNK .
And I 'm not talking about the wind , but we should be able to do the government , because the wind is going to be a threat to the birds , and the wind UNK will be two and a half .
They 're just birds .
And in West Africa , some people don 't respond to the UNK UNK of compassion and UNK .
Where are we doing that ? We 're studying these UNK ; we 're looking at them .
We 're trying to figure out what 's going on in the context of UNK and UNK .
And what we find is that they 're going to travel in different countries , so that if you just focus on one area , you 're hard to get there .
We need to work with the local government .
We 're trying to communicate with the local communities .
We 're trying to figure out what they know about UNK , and focus on the UNK of what they do .
And what are you going to do ? You can do it , you can write your government and tell them , we need to focus on the UNK of all of these things , and then we need to tell you about what we 've done .
When you walk in this room , you 're UNK , you 're not telling your family , you know , about your neighbors .
And they were that beautiful , and Charles Darwin said that he had to change his own perspective , he saw UNK UNK when he saw UNK at the sky in the sky .
In Kenya , there will be a lot of loss in the world who have lost these amazing species .
Thank you very much .
We can be able to help us live in a variety of ways .
We don 't have to be able to meet our neighbors , even if we 're living in the same public and the home in the same public space .
And so in the last couple of years I tried to have a different tool in a different way in which there was a lot of UNK tools between how to share with your neighbors and the neighbors .
And that all of these projects come back from my own questions , as my neighbors , how much of my neighbors ?
How can we be able to transmit something from your own and to avoid the UNK ?
How are we going to share better if we live in the UNK of the land and the better ?
How can we be able to express our communities into the UNK of our UNK and dream of our community and dream ?
And I was living in New Orleans and I was listening to love this city .
And all those of those things that had come from my mind , who had been my soul for many years now , UNK , UNK and UNK , and I was sure that this was a city of a music called UNK UNK .
And whenever I had ever felt that I felt new , I was looking for a UNK and a UNK team .
New Orleans , there are many of the most beautiful buildings in the world , but also , she 's the largest UNK city .
And I was living in this house , and I wanted to get it into a better place , and then the other thing changed my life .
In 2009 , I lost a man I love .
Her name was " UNK , " when my mother was going to die , she died .
And then I thought a lot about death of death of death , and it made me the time that I had the time that I had the time that I had the time that I had the right feeling .
But I 'm sure it 's going to be the same in the daily life .
And I think it 's very easy to see what it 's like to be UNK when you really believe .
And one of the things that I had spent in the UNK , when I had a UNK wall in the UNK , I was writing the same thing , and I was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a UNK in a public , and then I was able to be able to get a piece of UNK in the open and trying to share what they were doing , and then they wanted to share them about them .
And I don 't know what it 's like in the experiment , but the second day , the walls are UNK , and there 's got a new answer to this .
And I wanted to share with you a little bit about what it was writing about .
" Before , I wanted to be wondering my UNK behavior . "
" UNK , I thought I had a UNK date . "
" UNK , I wanted to play in a UNK audience . "
" Before , I wanted to be a tree .
" I wanted to get a UNK in my stomach . "
" I wanted to get back when you die .
" I wanted to be a UNK .
" Before , I wanted to do exactly real real . "
And it was forgotten that it had been forgotten to be a very , very powerful thing to be the dream that 's going to be the best of my dream that I had when I was feeling that I had a lot of time when it happened to me , when I had experienced my experience in my life .
It makes us believe it 's not alone .
And let 's see how new ideas we have in the neighborhood .
This is what we 've created with a UNK and thinking about what we 've been able to grow , what 's the most important part of what 's going on .
And what it was when I did last year and then , I had a lot of passion that people gave me the same stuff , and my colleagues and I had a small set of them , and then my colleagues and I had a small skeleton in the world , and then the wall is already in the world -- South Carolina , South Carolina , and so on .
And that 's the idea that if we could have one of the opportunities that we could share with each other , the public space that you are sharing with other people .
And one of the most precious things we have is a time , a time with other people .
In the UNK of this UNK period of life , remember that life is much more powerful than the living and life of life is greater than the past that 's ever been important .
We do not have the courage , and even though it doesn 't have a courage to go to death , but I realized that it 's the most powerful thing we can do .
And think about death may be able to make sure that your life is going to be heard about yourself .
And the public space can be better at what it is , or the community or the community , the ability we can help us , to help us , to help us , to help us , to help us be better , to help us be better about the better and the better life .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I was a UNK in Ghana where I was in Ghana .
The air was heavy , and it was very difficult to get clean .
And I could feel that UNK UNK , when I was in a dark , I can 't see the other .
And I heard all of you who had the same sound , but there are more and more and more noise than a UNK noise .
And as the other man , when I was in the middle of my head , he was UNK in a UNK suit with a UNK suit , and I had a UNK of a UNK in my neck , and it was the UNK of my UNK , my UNK .
And as I went back , I had finally to think that there was a painter that had come back for days before .
And when I 'm standing here today with you today , there was a lot of life working in this neighborhood , not the money , no money , no money .
And as I was last , my last year , at that time , was walking back home , and those of my UNK would never go home .
And in the last eight years , I 've been working on the UNK of the National UNK , and I was so fortunate that there was a lot of women in the United States in 2009 , in 2009 , in the UNK .
And there was a lot of UNK people who came up with a UNK , UNK , who was one of the UNK of UNK in the UNK Society of the UNK .
And we talked about UNK , and when I started really aware of the UNK reality , I 've been aware of the UNK of the world , but it 's not going to know that the bad news is going to be missing .
And as we ended up in the conversation , I felt a lot of a lot of time with the UNK of UNK so that we don 't know , but how many of you are ?
And this idea was going to be a few weeks later , when I flew a few weeks ago , then I flew to see the name of the UNK , and I wanted to get it out .
And that started me to the journey of modern UNK .
And the strange thing is , I 've been there .
And I think of them as being my second UNK .
But once again , I 'm going to go for some secret secret .
UNK is estimated that there are about UNK million people in the world today .
This is the number of times the number of UNK in the back of UNK in UNK .
150 years ago , one of the price of UNK was going to be three times more and more .
It 's about 50,000 trillion dollars today .
But today , a family of family are killed by 15 million dollars a day .
And it 's amazing , because there are millions of dollars per year in the world that 's produced by 15 billion dollars a year .
And many of them were being UNK by a UNK , good job and a good job , not to be able to get rid of what 's going to be done for violence .
And today 's today , today is about the product of the product of commercial services : creating value , but what you create value is something that 's valuable .
You know , you know , you know , every single corner in the world , even though it 's not illegal , it 's illegal .
In India , I was sent to UNK .
And it 's kind of weird to what happens when you walk into the ancient and UNK .
And in the last 50 degrees of UNK , women , children and children , actually , a local family of UNK UNK on my head of UNK and UNK , and then UNK it up for about 40 million meters away .
UNK and UNK , they were quiet , they had a UNK and a half , a half , a half , a half a day .
You can 't eat , you can 't eat , you can 't eat .
And because there was nothing left between the UNK and UNK of my camera , my camera and my camera .
Every 20 minutes , I 've got to get back to my device so that it can be done in the air in the air , and then I sat in front of the car and I was waiting for a lot of people who wanted to be better than those things .
And I wanted to come back , when I wanted to be crying , and I thought , I wanted to go back and say , I said , " UNK UNK , don 't cry here . "
And he told me that it 's dangerous to say that it 's dangerous for me like this .
I 'm not able to give them anything to help .
I couldn 't give them money . I can 't give it .
I 'm not the citizen of the nation .
And my behavior would be possible to make them be worse than that .
And I would only expect to be able to be UNK in the UNK , and I think they can be able to do that .
And as I was , I had to wait back to get back in my house and then I wanted to get this UNK .
And in the Himalayas , I saw a child with a UNK , a few kilometers away from the UNK and the UNK trucks .
And the kids who had a lot of a kid who had a child had a lot of kids , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK .
It 's a very painful thing to see .
How are we going to be able to get rid of all of these things , but that 's the common thing ?
Some of them don 't even know that they were working at the time that they were working at the time that they were working on a UNK or every day .
There 's no difference .
And if all of these people are going to get their freedom for free , then all of them will be their house .
And these guys were tired , and they wanted to be free , but they had been working on the UNK in the middle of the country , and they kept there , but now it 's time to get the same thing , but now it 's time to get there , and then you get a doctor and you get a free .
And one of the things that we 've heard about is that when we hear the UNK , the most often , the most important thing that we 've heard about , is that many of us , I 've been told , is that , when I insisted in the industry , it 's going to be a very good job .
And on the UNK , I was a UNK woman who had been UNK .
And they took me back in a UNK , and I took a look at a UNK in the tent .
It 's not a UNK .
It 's more like a restaurant .
And then it 's got to be UNK when you 're UNK .
And on the other hand , women and children and children had seven and a half of them , and they were asked to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more .
Each of the UNK with a very UNK wall UNK , with three UNK and UNK .
And people who are working on this job is often UNK .
And remember that there was a terrible fear in the dark side of my life when I wanted to be stuck in that hell .
Here 's one of the UNK : I have been walking down my way down .
There 's no UNK .
There was no window .
And these guys couldn 't escape , because when we faced something that 's difficult to all of us , it 's important to know that , because it 's in the front of our backyard , it 's in the same way .
Hundreds of thousands of people are UNK UNK and family UNK .
And recently , the New York Times has about 100,000 children in the United States every year in the United States .
And that 's what happens . We don 't know .
It 's also what we 've heard about UNK labor .
I visited a village in India that 's the UNK of the UNK trade .
This is a man 's " UNK . "
And on the left hand , they were two sons and red hands two sons .
And they UNK in a UNK , and then they go back in the UNK , and when it comes back to the UNK , it 's toxic .
Show me tell my story .
" We said , " we don 't know . "
" And we hope , we 'll be able to get rid of the room where you 're going to get money else . "
It 's estimated that there are more than 20 million children in the world , there are the world 's biggest UNK in the world .
And we came there , and I went to see a little bit about what it looks like .
And I see a man who 's got two brothers in the boat , a few two young kids , right ?
No . They were all of them .
The kids were sent from their home and had been trained to work at the bottom of the boat , even though they weren 't going to swim .
This boy is eight years old .
And when our boat came over , he was paralyzed by his UNK , our UNK .
And he was going to fall back to the water .
And the UNK in the background is UNK , and those kids who are scared , who are afraid that they are UNK .
Many hundred .
And from that point , it 's been UNK .
And he was scared of the man , not to go away from him , because he had been a severe man , and he had a very different approach for him , and he used to be different than he had a little UNK .
And when I was in my morning , I saw these girls at the end of the end , and they started working in the morning a little bit .
It 's cold ; it 's cold .
You know , you know , there 's thousands of pounds when you get these fish out .
I 'm going to talk about you about UNK .
He 's been released from a farm .
And saw he was a UNK in his family called UNK .
And at the end of this day , he 's working on a UNK truck , and the good news that 's going on is the right time and the family has given you the right , and they 're able to make a living and make the kids safe .
There 's a possibility of possibility .
You know , because someone showed you what it means , it 's going to change the future of his life , that 's what 's going to change .
It 's driving in the back of a UNK to the UNK , which is the UNK of your UNK , and it 's going to be as fast as we can drive .
And he asked us to start with a UNK in his UNK .
And on the end of the road , he 's going to take us out of the driver and take us back .
And then he said one of the things in the ground , and it says , " That 's the path . Go ! "
And we got about two hours in the UNK , and we had about a hundred thousand barrels of oil , and we gave my pen a little bit to the top of the UNK in the top of my head .
And then we walked two hours with two hours , and we had a big UNK in the world where everybody was working on the ground .
Many women also have their children , and they 're walking in their UNK and UNK .
UNK is used to extract the gold .
These people are UNK in a UNK in Ghana .
And when they came up with the outside , they had a UNK .
And I remember then they had been working on the red and all of the hands , and I had been working for a lot of people working for a long time .
There 's about 90 meters in the middle of these UNK , they have been able to get rid of the UNK of the UNK , and then it 's used to get into the UNK of the other place to get rid of the gold .
And the men of UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , but we 're looking at the UNK and we find a few kids on the edge , there 's a disability and some kids .
They were the victims of UNK violence .
In fact , many of these things , when you get a black man , it 's possible to be UNK by the same as well as being killed by UNK and tuberculosis .
This is UNK . When his father died , his uncle sent him into his neighborhood where he was working .
He died when he died , and UNK him into his uncle , and he was going to continue to be working on the UNK .
And when I met him , he had been working on the UNK , he had seen a UNK in the UNK of my life when they wanted to be UNK .
And instead of that man , he also had a disease , even though he had the same job that he had to do every day .
And even though that , he also was grateful to be able to be able to be successful in the UNK of the UNK , and that 's what 's going to be the right thing to make sure that I had a lot of faith in my life .
I wanted us to give them the UNK to the people .
And when I took this painting , I took a lot of them to be able to help me with my paintings , and I wanted to light up my story and their UNK , and when we were safe , I took a series of photos left .
They know they 're going to see all the time .
And I wanted them to know , we 'll be able to figure out how we could change their lives .
And I do believe that when we put them together , it 's difficult to get rid of that kind of thing .
It 's not about the subject , it 's about who 's the power of life , dignity and respect .
And I didn 't want this beautiful , but it was UNK .
And I wanted these images to be able to give you a gift in your mind , and I wanted the power of the power to be the UNK of the UNK , and that would be the UNK of UNK in the shadow .
Thank you .
You know , it 's one of the things that I 've learned about when you learn from every study of UNK , is that it 's a very interesting question , and that 's what we are doing with .
Nobody knows what we are .
So I 'm going to show you some examples of what we do .
Well , dance is one of the UNK of human beings .
And we all know about it in UNK and UNK .
Now , what 's wrong with this UNK knowledge of UNK knowledge and great expertise is even what 's going to be right now , and that 's what it 's all about .
But unfortunately , the nervous disease , for example , is the UNK of UNK , which is the UNK of my friends in my friend , UNK UNK , who is his UNK UNK .
And he had a lot of treatments , and he had a lot of a lot of treatments .
And yet , there 's the disease , and they have to be UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , and so on .
And one of the things that we need to measure is that we need to know that the only way to get the right step is to tell us what 's going on .
But what 's really amazing is that UNK diseases , no matter what you can 't do , you can 't be able to do it so you can 't be able to do the best thing that you can do , and that 's like 20 billion minutes .
You have to get a clinic , and it 's very big , and that 's what happened in clinical trials .
But what if you can get this test in your house ?
Could you pay for the patient 's time for a patient , if you can only be able to be able to get this test ?
You don 't need a lot of money to hire employees .
By the way , if you go to the clinic , you can have 300 dollars .
So I wanted to introduce you with a UNK approach that we could try to go and do something , because you know , in a sense , at least as my friend UNK UNK .
I have a video from UNK UNK .
This is a healthy state , and that 's what we want to think of ourselves as the sound of sound , because when we listen to the language , we have to have a UNK brain , which is something called UNK .
And it 's working on the same thing as well .
And it 's time to think about it .
And as we go through the sound , we can go to the UNK in the UNK , as we can see , that we can make the difference between organs .
You can see the UNK on the bottom is a UNK UNK .
We see the symptoms .
The sound of the sound , the UNK , the UNK .
And then it 's going to be , and then it 's going to be a lot of UNK , because it 's the symptoms of the symptoms .
In fact , one of the things that 's really difficult for most of these things , when there 's something that you 're going to be in the right place , it 's a very sophisticated machine that 's going to be right now , right now , right now , right now , when we can get it right now and say the same thing that 's going to be healthy and disease , and that 's just one of the things that we can focus on , and that 's the equivalent between health and disease , and it 's just one of the stuff that only takes a lot of what 's going on .
So what are the UNK of this ? What are they going to do with that ? And they are actually UNK .
It 's hard to say that it 's impossible , and it 's used to be the infrastructure of the UNK device .
You don 't need a whole new hospital to go up and test a test .
They 're all UNK . And , of course , the test test doesn 't seem to be UNK .
It means that the patient is able to get rid of themselves .
And then it 's fast , and most about 30 seconds .
And the price is very low , and we know how to do it again .
And once it 's very high , it 's going to grow .
And that 's what I want to see right now .
We can reduce the UNK problems with the patient .
You can 't do it with your clinic .
And we can do it with UNK algorithms .
We can get a lot of clinical trials with clinical trials , and we can drive up the amount of time in the first time in the first time .
We also have the opportunity to find the disease , in the early days of UNK .
So let 's start with the first step in this direction , and we started UNK UNK UNK .
And with UNK and UNK , we wanted to record all of the world 's voices in a number of different targets .
We have a UNK planet on the planet 's UNK .
And any health or any disease , I love to say that every time just three or three years , I 'm glad that we 've just got eight percent of our targets in the back of eight hours .
Thank you .
And Richard , in this case , is to say that in 10,000 , you can see who 's healthy , who 's suffering ?
And what are you thinking about this ?
Right , yes . So this is what it 's like to say that you 've got this disease : you 've got this disease . UNK : Yeah .
You know , some people can 't say we , or we don 't .
But we 're going to get a lot of data from different environments , and the point is different environments , because that 's what we can get away from this disease .
So are you now going to have a UNK right now ?
And it 's going to be far bigger than that .
In fact , my students , my student , I had to mention him , because he made a good job , and he 's now that we 're moving back to this project , and now we 're going to be talking about 99 percent of the time .
Yeah , well , that 's pretty cool .
So what that means is that people can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get your phone back into your phone , so that people can go back and listen to the phone , and then they 'll be able to figure out what they do , and then they 're the ones that they 're in this disease .
That 's all .
Thank you very much . Thomas UNK .
Thank you .
And since I had enough that , I had a lot of fun , but I wanted to share with 15 and a half years old , and there was no one of my favorite pictures , and there was one of my favorite .
There 's no art , there 's no UNK opportunity , there 's no UNK .
In fact , most of them are random .
And one of my stories , my wife , when my wife came to my wife , my wife , my wife , my daughter , my daughter , is her birthday , and we 're standing on the UNK of the UNK and the fifth of the UNK .
And we went back to New York , and we decided to take a picture of the same picture .
You can guess how it 's going .
And at the end of my daughter , my wife , to his wife , said , " Why don 't you go back to New York City to go to this old ? "
And that 's where we started from the road from this journey to get out of the road .
You know , it 's a very unusual thing to see if you 're having a camera in the camera .
No one 's ever going to say no one of our cameras , not too much .
At that time , we didn 't know that this journey was going to change the lives of our lives .
For us , it 's going to be sacred .
This was a few weeks after 9 weeks , and I was trying to explain what was to try to do this in five and a half minutes .
So these pictures are just three times , or a very early journey .
They 're the time that we remember when we remember the next week in the back of the summer , and how we have changed , not just the change of the body , but the change of the change .
Because , when I was in the same time with every year , we had the same thing , and when she got to life , I was looking at her life in her eyes , looking at how she was going on .
This is the time that we were working on for a year when we were the most important time ever .
And recently , when we walked in the road , she suddenly stopped , and she was a red and a red , and she said that she was very happy in the journey of the journey before we started .
She told me when she was five .
And she said she was looking at the first time when she saw her , it was nine years ago .
And now she went to New York , because she decided to go to New York .
And I suddenly understood that what we create is the most important thing we create .
So I wanted to share the idea of being able to create the idea of ideas .
And I don 't know about you , but my family , except for those 15 pictures , I 'm not going to be talking about my family .
And I always had this photograph of the camera .
And I 'd like to encourage you to be here today , to be here today , to go to the picture , to the UNK , to the UNK man , " Can you help us ? "
Thank you .
