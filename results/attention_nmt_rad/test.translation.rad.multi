I was 11 years old , and I remember , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
My father 's father at the same time with his wife , UNK UNK .
And so he 's kind of sorry , and it 's very rare , because the news is only for him .
" UNK UNK ! " Dad said .
I didn 't know what that means , but I can see the father very happy .
" You 're going to go to the real university . " He said .
I would never forget that one morning .
It 's a real school .
I was six years old , and UNK UNK was a good job .
And so , in my next year , I was invited to take a secret school to my sister , and I didn 't know if I was a UNK .
This is our own education program .
We 're going to have a different amount of progress , and we don 't know where we 're going to go .
We 're going to put ourselves in the food chain , and that 's what we just want to do .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , 10 of them are in a small room .
It was great , but it was hot .
We all know that our own risk of life , the teacher , the teacher and the family , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Sometimes , the school went off , and it was great for the first time because the Soviet Union didn 't know .
And so we always wanted to figure out to be a UNK .
Where are we waiting ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were afraid , but we still wanted to learn school .
I was lucky enough to be a member of the girl 's family .
My grandfather , my grandfather , was a very poor man .
He was able to UNK his life in the region , and he had no idea what to do , and my mother , my mother , to go to school , to school , to give his father to his father .
But my mother 's father became a teacher .
That 's her .
And she spent two years two years ago , and it gave me a school , and the girl and the girls .
My father was father , and he was the first person in his family .
So you know , he 's okay , his child is being taught by education , including his daughter , and it 's got to risk .
For him , child didn 't have a higher risk for education .
And so , I remember when I was a young man in London , I remember that I was really afraid that my life felt that it was going to happen , and it was not going to happen to see the future .
I want to give up , but my father 's father will say , " Wow , my daughter , my daughter , you can lose what your life is .
Your money would be killed , and you might be able to save war .
And , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if we 're not going to be able to make a drug that 's not that , we will be wrong .
Even if you still want to go ? "
I 'm 25 years old .
I grew up on a whole country that was launched by a few years of war .
And I didn 't know that as a child , and it was six percent , and if not , I would say , like many of us , I would like to give you a couple of people , and I would like to give you a couple of people .
And I 'm now being proud of a kind of a UNK student .
The UNK is a UNK in the United States , and it 's about 25 percent of the United States in the United States , and when I got to Afghanistan , I was asked by my father 's family , and I gave them to my family .
And he was not just about my university , and it was because I was the first one , and I was the first one , and I was the first one who was working on the streets of UNK Street .
My family 's my responsibility .
My dream was much bigger , but they didn 't even have a lot to me .
And this is why I became the idea of 10 to 10 , and this is a global organization that was a global education .
And that was the reason why I was able to create a UNK , and this is the first thing , probably the good thing , because in Afghanistan , it 's good for us to learn how to teach kids and how good it is , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan .
I was excited about that , and I saw my students in school , and I saw a couple of things .
And I saw my UNK , especially if my father 's father , like my father 's friends , and we saw that in the face of his face .
For instance , it 's not true , but I can 't show you what it 's about to be his father , and he 's my father 's father .
Not a month ago , he was working with his daughter in school , and they were just a little bit of a UNK .
And when he was home , he said , a voice says that he was going to take care to school , when he was going to happen again .
" If you think about it , " and I said , " No , I can 't pay for you . "
And by the way , I realized -- this is the Western house -- I didn 't know -- it was one of the things that we worked on , and it was the success of his success , which was the success of his own success .
Now , this is not about the fact that the mother 's not only about our success .
And in fact , for example , for example , the daughter was about , and , most of us , most of us , most of us , but the social community , but we had to have a strong support .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don 't forget , you know , time .
But today , Afghanistan is about 30 million years of education .
Afghanistan and America are very different .
And I found that the United States would see that we can change the balance of change .
And so I worried about these things that were being trained by the UNK .
But when I went to Afghanistan to Afghanistan and my students , I remember my parents , I saw the hope of the future , and you see this kind of change .
And for me , Afghanistan has given hope to hope , and it 's about my daughter 's daughter that 's going to be about me .
Like , I have a dream of hope .
Thank you .
And what I did was , whether I was born , or life , and my whole life -- I felt that young people in Africa have lived in Africa in Africa .
I was young , and I was a young man , and I was a young man , and I was able to -- I was a man , a UNK , a career , a UNK , a UNK , a UNK program , a UNK program .
And I worked in a way that I wanted to do a project in Africa , and I failed .
And I was shocked .
When I was about 12 years old , I felt that we were happy , and we were curious about this in Africa .
And yet , what do we do ?
Our first project gave me a book about a book called " UNK UNK , " and we said , " The first thing about this project is that it 's not the same thing as a religious person .
And so what we did was we put a bunch of fun from South Africa , a picture of UNK , UNK , and we taught people about people and UNK and UNK .
And of course , when people are not interested in this , so we pay them to do , and they 're going to come to one day .
And it 's also not that kind of thing that 's really bad for us , but the local people are not quite familiar with them .
But we didn 't ask them why , but that 's what we got . "
" UNK UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK . "
And of course , in Africa , you know , in Africa .
And so , we have a very beautiful model that we have , and it turns out to be , in fact , a piece of paper that 's so important that it 's going to be so much of this .
It 's hard to believe ; we talk to people , " Look , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And when it was done , it was about , by the way , it was about two or a half hours ago , from two weeks of UNK on the screen , and it was kind of cool .
We talk to us , " My God , these are dead . "
And I said , " No , that 's not what we 're doing here . "
" You know what ? You know , you know ? "
And I thought , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Because of course , we ate ourselves .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
You can read this book , " UNK UNK , " and " UNK UNK , " and " The UNK . "
This book was published in 2007 .
We spent these countries in the last 50 years , and it 's about 25 billion dollars in the last 50 years .
And I 'm not going to show you a little bit about what this looks like .
And you read about it .
You see , there 's lots of other things that we can see , and it 's got a lot of hope for us .
The West is the UNK , the UNK , and we put people in the way that people have , and you know , UNK , you know , two of them are UNK .
These two words come from " UNK UNK . "
But two words are different .
You know , you know , you know , I mean , you know , I gave you a different approach to my wife , " I love you . "
UNK means that I took another case to my other people .
And that 's why it 's called " UNK , " and " UNK . "
And I was talking about a book , and this book was called " UNK , " and it was about , by the way , the first one is , if people don 't want to help them to do this .
And this is what aid is about .
The most important thing about aid is respect .
And so , in the morning , this is going to be a UNK , and said , " We can 't -- you know , can you imagine a city that 's not being told by the city of the city ? "
I did a decision to make a decision , and I started a job of people , and I did a job of people , and I didn 't help them , but we didn 't do it for people 's lives , but we found people who were better than people were born .
And so what we 're going to do is , you know .
We 're going to put a community into a community that 's not going to make any sense , but it 's about to connect to each other .
Our job is not in office .
We see ourselves on the restaurant .
We didn 't have any infrastructure .
And so what we did was , they were friends and found that they were interested .
But most importantly , you know .
You can put your eyes on the door .
But if you had to be interested in , you know what ?
The UNK is the most important part of the self , which is the most important thing .
That 's what 's happening here , and it 's the most important thing , and it 's about the most important thing .
Then we helped them to learn knowledge knowledge and information , because it 's green , and it 's not going to be built .
And there are a couple of other people who don 't want to believe that , but we can provide support .
And so many years ago , I had an idea that we were not going to be able to listen to them , but we didn 't know what to do with our thinking , but that 's not going to be the case of social media .
I tell you a secret .
The community has a problem .
The entrepreneurs never know , they didn 't show you , they 'd just put it on the table , and they found out what was going on .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
You can 't even see the people in the community , because they didn 't really care about your public .
And our approach is , by the way , for the community , for the future , we must build the social infrastructure that we have .
We had to create a whole new career .
And this is a professional doctor , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're sitting in your house , and you 're going to have to take care of your work , and it helps you to be able to bring your creative balance into your creativity .
I was working on a UNK in Australia , in Australia .
And so I was reading , and tried to put that up on the side of the story , and it was just going to be a little bit more .
And I was asked to leave the first year , and I got a first house , and I helped , and I asked him to put a UNK in a garage , and he said , " You know , you know , if you want to give up to people who 's in the car , you know , you know , you know , " How are you going to help us to help us ? "
And I said , " Well , it 's about 50 percent of the size of a UNK in the United States , but it 's about five dollars a day , and you know , " Hey , you know , " Hey , you can help us , can help us help us ? "
And I did this in three years , and the guy came to me and said , " What do you do ?
How are you going to -- I said , " I said , " I did a very hard thing .
That 's where it comes , listen to them . "
So -- -- so the people said , " That 's going to do . "
We launched this program in the world .
We have helped to build 40 of them .
The new generation of innovation is going to be different than anything else .
UNK UNK , the largest number of UNK in the world , has been born , UNK , UNK , UNK .
UNK is a UNK professor who said , " The idea of UNK UNK has said , " The idea of creating social innovation is not . "
The plan is getting depressed .
Now , we rebuild the city of New Zealand , and we didn 't know how to use their own money to use their own money .
We need to learn how to make them .
And we had to give them the secret to help them , and we need to take people to help them , and they would come into water .
We have 200 families in the next 10 years , and we have about 200 of them .
How would you imagine an average community , a social community , UNK ?
Now , how many of us do you want to talk to you ?
It 's the local community . You know , you know .
So what I 'd like to say is that the European Union is the source of social activity .
And when we did the first revolution in the first revolution -- we were able to make it happen , and we realized that it was not sustainable .
And there was a lot of natural gas in the air .
It 's not going to be a long way to eat food .
What we 're going to try is , how do we take these things that we can take away from the way that we 're going to have about 50 percent of food and medical information and services and demand .
Now , technology is more than that .
Who is going to be able to prove this technology to make a green revolution ? Don 't remember me .
Does it happen ? Don 't .
It 's the professional leaders , and they 're about them .
And so many years ago , I saw a funny article in the future .
In the year , there was a man who was invited to speak to the city of New York City .
And so , this is about 10 years later , and this is about 10 years later , and it 's about 10 years old , and it 's not going to be happening next to 10 years , and it turns out that New York City is not going to be there .
Why ? Because they looked at the surface on the surface , you know , if you put it on this speed , it would take about 10 million dollars , and it 's almost impossible to do anything about it .
You know , people would come out of them .
So for example , they think it 's going to kill the revolution of New York City .
And so , in 30 years , in 30 years , in the ' 60s , in the U.K. , in the country , in 2010 , there was about 100 million cars -- there was about 10 of them .
You can find a new technology , and it turns out , and it 's got a lot of work .
For example , for example , for example , HIV / AIDS .
And yet , entrepreneurs are starting to have a secret .
First , you 've got to give them the commitment .
They 're not going to talk to you .
And you have to pay attention to them .
You 're going to tell them what they 're talking about .
And it 's not as big as a small thing , but it 's a little bit more than a third one , and it 's about , you know , UNK , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you get
What 's the problem ?
There 's no one person to do that , and it 's going to work .
This isn 't there .
That 's what it 's going to happen .
And we did that , but , in the developing world , in the developing world , in the world , the European Union , the European Union , the UNK company , the UNK company , the UNK company , the UNK of the media , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK .
And there 's a difference in the world , only one of them , only one : no one is being created by creating creativity .
Now , in the same way , I was asked by the fact that I was starting to put a UNK in Germany , and I started to show you a little bit of a lot of work , a lot of work , a lot of times , " We said , " Let 's say , " and I said , " Let 's say , " and I said , " Let 's say , " and I said , " Let 's say , " and I said , " Let 's do this . "
" I don 't have any time , " we 've got these two . "
He 's just a little bit different from his hand .
No one 's going to die . No .
And so we can build a community , in this community , in the same way , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , what do you want to do with you ?
What can you do ? How can you produce ?
Are you going to be able to leave you ? Are you going to pay ? "
" Well , I 'm not going to die . How am I going to help you ? "
We dance to the community community .
And we have volunteers who 's going to help the government to help the community and the human , and we found that people can change the social and economic changes that we can , and that 's what it 's like to do , and this is the ability to do this kind of thing .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I had a UNK experience .
And my name was asked me that the teachers who studied a medical engineer to engineer the program .
I was shocked .
I was really afraid that , in fact , there was a huge amount of brain , and there was a lot of people who were told me that they didn 't get me .
But by the way , my experience , my experience , my experience , my wife 's book , to see that there was a whole new world .
And that 's what I really wanted to do with those kids , and I was thinking about them , and I wanted to be able to experience this experience to experience this kind of experience .
And I believe that the key thing about this is that there are good kinds of communication and communication .
And to change the world , we need to bring ourselves from our own scientists and engineers .
And our scientists and engineers understand that it 's about the most important question that we 've ever found , and the way we can 't understand that , and if we don 't understand them , and I believe that we are responsible for our scientists , and we believe that we have responsibility to interact with each other .
But if our scientists and engineers aren 't allowed us to see their neighbors , we might not be able to have good progress .
So scientists and engineers , please tell us what technology is .
I 'd like to share a couple of you with a couple of things , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
The first question is , how do we have a problem with technology ?
Tell us , why do you have memory ?
And it 's not just about my research , or to tell you that it 's important because it 's important to realize that it 's important for us to learn how to make a difference .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The language is that we understand that you want to make a sense of what you want to do .
And of course , you can say , you can say , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
Let 's just give you a simple idea of simplicity .
Instead , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's not easy to say , but it 's not so simple .
You don 't have to change your mind , but you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
You can think about some examples and stories and stories , and it 's all about your talk about your talk , and it makes us happy .
And it 's about to show you how it works . It doesn 't make a little bit more .
You want to be able to say , " Well , do you want to be a little bit better ?
What 's the object here ? You can take away from your head .
So like this slide like this , you know , it 's not just about our language , and it 's not about us .
And it was so much , it was much better than that , because it was so much better than we talked about the size of the size of the skull , and even more than a UNK in the UNK UNK of UNK UNK .
And the problem with this is that it 's a little bit more easy to read , but it 's not going to be a little bit easier to give us a sense of what 's going on , and it can bring us to the sense of what 's going on inside the way we want to describe it .
And so I think that 's what I think is going to help us with the news that we want to take care of , and the good way to learn and engineering and engineering .
And so , as a scientist , I wanted to learn from my colleagues that I was thinking about what I was going to do , and I wanted to put my perspective on my perspective .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And so , scientists and engineers , when you know about this program , you want to change the way you think about technology .
Thank you .
I love the words that I love to call the English language , " UNK UNK . "
Not because it sounds great .
And the idea is , " It 's a UNK world . "
And yet , this is just a good definition , and he said , " UNK is a man , and he 's going to be a UNK , and he 's going to take care of what 's going on at the same time , but he 's going to be about 30 percent of the time . "
I was a little kid , and I didn 't know what to do with UNK .
It 's about the words of language and the language of language .
But it 's a very important thing to do , and it 's very important for the political , and it 's all about trying to control their language .
For example , for example , in the ' 60s , the British Society would come to a new way to speak to the real language of religion .
And in fact , it 's all about being a male , and this is the name of a man named UNK UNK .
He 's been told by London , but he was a very brave man who had a lot of courage to get involved , and he was waiting for a lot of support from the London .
And for years , we had a first lesson that we wanted to learn how to read a book called " UNK UNK . "
A lot of people think this is what 's happening in the United States .
No , it 's about a new kind of freedom .
But to try to figure out the truth of truth and political information , I wanted you to know where you go to the United States , and it 's just like a UNK .
And then they had a problem with a question : How do you call UNK UNK , who leaders , their leaders .
They didn 't know .
How do you have to be a member and a country ?
The problem with this is that there was a long time .
And there 's lots of laws , and it 's going to work like that .
I mean , some people want to call him a UNK , and some of them are called UNK Street , and they 're called UNK , and they 're called UNK , and it 's called the United States UNK that he was working on .
No one 's name .
Some people want to call him UNK .
And they thought it was a symbol that was used to experience .
And they didn 't even have to go to jail , and they said , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you can ask , you know , you can ask , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you can ask , you know , you know , you
You know , that 's going to happen .
And each one of us is suffering from the experience , and , in fact , it 's about three and a half years .
And I read a UNK who was talking to me about this talk , " You know , you know , you know , " That 's not the case . "
And the reason for that is the case is the case of civil war .
UNK didn 't want to make a difference .
They didn 't want to give him what he wants to do for the same time as he would want to do .
And so they gave him a UNK , and the worst thing about it is that it 's not possible .
And this is called " UNK . "
UNK UNK , who didn 't build it . I mean , well , this is what it looks like , but it 's a symbol of the conference .
And the same idea is similar to each other .
And it 's not really quite a particularly extraordinary , but it 's called " UNK . "
And yet , there 's a couple of other people who have a lot of UNK , and there 's a lot of other things that it does , but it really 's not what it looks like .
And that 's why it 's so hard to do this .
And they said , " It 's really hard to say , you can 't talk to God .
It 's also going to have to be able to learn how to look at it .
Who would tell him , if only one of them was about the size of a man with a man named UNK UNK , UNK UNK ?
And after three weeks , it 's not a UNK .
And as an example , they also agreed to be able to do this , but they 'd like to put it on the idea of the fact that it 's not about the size of the way , but it 's not only in the same way , but it 's also not going to be the same as an event that 's going to be , and we don 't want to see a different change in the same way .
Now , this story that you can see is something interesting .
First of all , it was my favorite place , which I was able to find out of , because I was never going to find out how to make a difference that was never going to be true of the word " The UNK . "
UNK is , " UNK , " right now , " right now , " right now , but it 's still not only in a while , but it 's just going to be anything that 's going on in the same way .
The second thing you can see is that the U.S. government asked you , it 's just about two years -- it 's about 25 years old .
But the third thing is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
You know , there are about 50 of these seven surgeries , and there are also the largest economy in the world , and there 's also a lot of other things that are happening to the other side of the world .
The reality and the history of this experiment .
And so , finally left .
They got to know what they want to do .
And the other thing about this is the other thing , and this is what it looks like , and it 's not surprising to me .
But now , you know , how many countries have you here ?
UNK .
And that 's because they wanted to put up on the street , like that would be more likely to be about 500 of these instruments , etc .
And then , by the end of the day , the president came out of the civil war because it 's not going to happen if they were told that they were going to be an American government .
And this is important to me that I think you can learn , and I want to give you a little bit of this .
The government has tried to choose the word and use the content and use it , but in fact , it turns out to change the reality of what 's happening in terms of the universe .
Thank you very much .
And I was about to give you a couple of 50 or a half , and I was 17 years old , and I was 17 years old , and I was a UNK of the UNK of the UNK of UNK in Florida .
I use my yellow UNK UNK on a UNK wall , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
This is my first time to Afghanistan .
The first time , I was in the middle of the war in the war , and I was looking at the size of a friend of a man who was asked by a friend of a man and a man in the audience , and he said , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
But that 's what it looks like .
And so I 'm standing here at MIT , and I was on a UNK in Afghanistan , and I was a UNK and a UNK , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And in Afghanistan , you can imagine the art of the art of the art , but I wanted to figure out how to make a difference , and I wanted to make a difference that was used as a way of being able to make a sense of what was happening in the world .
And I 'd like to give you a little bit of a war , and he looked at me , and he was on a street in the middle of the UNK , and it was made to be a UNK and a way to make a difference .
And so , in order to speak , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , well , I 'm a UNK , and I 'm a UNK , and you know , what do I mean by this ?
And so I tried to try to figure out what to do with the UNK of his wife , who became the father of the country .
And I 'd like to put this in a UNK in a UNK , and it looked like a police police , and you know , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you want to sell them to people , you know , maybe you want to give them 10 to 10 of them .
And I wanted to know how I was going to try to put my perspective back to the South Pole .
And the idea of the war and the UNK of the past , and it 's only being used by a kind of UNK in the orchestra , which I think is about to be able to figure out what 's going on in the same way that we 're going to be able to figure out what 's going on in the same way that we 're going to be able to figure out what 's going on in the same way that we 're going to be able to figure out what 's in the city of a UNK in a UNK in the same way .
And I also wanted to put it a little bit more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more people to see , " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and " UNK , " and
But to do these things , you might be able to UNK them .
But I had to do that , because my self is going to be going to do it .
That 's what I mean , what about you ?
Thank you .
Hi , I 'm a UNK , an example of the past , and I was a model .
And I was born for 10 years .
Now , I feel that in this room , in this room , in this room , you know , because I don 't have to wear them alone .
UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK .
Now , this is the first time that TED is going to show you today , so I think it 's going to be a lot of people here .
And if there 's a woman who 's going to feel that I found that I was not aware of , but I was going to know that in a while , but I was there .
And I also want to tell you , I got lucky , and I started to show you how it works .
That 's not what people can do .
And that 's not a good thing to do , and it 's not good for us , but I can 't move them .
The worst news is that I 'm going to put this into the slide , because it 's like , you know , when I 'm sorry , you 're not going to see what I 'm wearing when you are .
You can .
Now , why do I do that ?
It 's amazing .
And hopefully that 's not going to be like images like this .
It 's kind of powerful . It 's just about the surface .
I 'm just going to change the image of the size of what you 're thinking about .
And so , in this picture , I actually put a couple of new friends in this picture .
And when I was a UNK , I was really kind of old UNK , and I was really bad at that .
And the idea is , by the surgery or two or three days ago , I think we can 't change the surface of what 's going on , but the surface of the surface , which is the landscape of the surface , and it 's a huge impact that we live in our lives .
And so today , for me , it was just impossible to make a difference .
I stand here today because I was a model .
And I was there with this video because I was a beautiful man , and we kind of love it for our lives .
And I 'm going to ask you a little bit more about what 's going on there .
The first question is , you know how to make a model ?
And I always say , " I 'm being discovered , " but that 's not true .
And I became a UNK , because I was able to put a UNK genome , and I was a UNK of the clinic , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Well , in the last couple of years , we also have a responsibility that 's not only about healthy health and women , and it 's kind of like us to be able to give you a sense of what 's going on in terms of the body and the size of the body .
And this is what I did , and this is what I 've been looking at today .
And I know some of you may be interested in this idea , but you might have some sort of UNK , like UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK .
First , I want to give you a sense of what 's happening in the physical world .
But unfortunately , I had to tell you , with a New York Times at New York City , it was only about 25 percent , but it was six percent , it was six .
The next time , I asked , I was asked , " How long would I be a UNK ? "
My first answer was , " I don 't know , because they don 't really want to use it .
But the second question is , I wanted to ask questions about questions about why , why is that ? "
You know ? You can choose anything .
You can be a member of the United States or a UNK , or a UNK , or an example , and it 's not the first time , because you would be the first one .
If , you know , please , if they said , " No , no , I would say , " I would say , " I want to do this . "
Because I can 't decide anything , because you can be a UNK of the United States , or UNK , or a UNK UNK .
And you know , you know , when you think about it , it 's like you 're going to want to leave you with your size .
It 's not going to be a model : no matter how it is , but it 's not a good business .
And I 'm going to show you a little bit about some of these experiences from the early ' 60s , and it 's almost as if it 's not , like a UNK .
So , if you take a picture of this slide on here , and it 's like a UNK that 's on the size of the night , and I want to leave you with one of these hands , and you know , well , you know , you know , you know , 30 years later , you know , you know , 30 , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four
It looks like this .
I hope that 's not going to be the case .
I didn 't know where that was about .
And , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you want to be able to talk to you about the size of the United States , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And the next question is , " Is they going to take pictures ? "
Yes , they would move all the pictures , but it was just a small part of this .
And this is my first model , which is my first time that I haven 't seen before .
I know it 's going to happen , but I was a young man .
This is the picture of my photo , which was the picture of my grandmother .
This is the picture .
And I was friends with my friends .
This is my view of my country , and I was going to show you a picture of a couple of days ago , a couple of days ago .
This is a picture of me , I was at the UNK and the magazine .
This is what we 're today .
What I want you to know is that this is not my picture .
And so , by the way , a group of people came out of a group of people , engineers , UNK and UNK , and UNK them , and we built them , and we built them to make these images , not me .
The next question is , " How do you get to free ? "
I was really , you know , it was never going to go into the South Pole , but the thing was done , but I was talking about what was happening in reality , and this is what we want to talk about .
I spent a lot of time a week , and I moved to a house , and I was asked by my money .
10 years old , I was working with a friend of mine , and I was a UNK , and I was a UNK , and we said , " UNK , we 're going to move . "
And I got these things because I was part of my UNK , but some of them came out of them , but some of them took care of them .
And I was in New York , and I was 14 years old , and I was told by a UNK boy who was a young man and a young man .
And so , in New York , in New York City , the men and women were told , " The question is , " The question is not . "
And I said , " What would I do ? How would I be ? "
And I was about to do this talk , and I found that it was about 25 percent of the time in the United States , and it was about 75 percent .
So the last question is , " What 's the model ? "
And I guess the answer is , " If you get a little bit better , your hair 's going to be happy , you know , you 're happy . "
And then , when we 're going to give a picture like this .
And we said , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Now , it 's not that it 's not only for us , but because we 're never going to talk about this , I 'm not going to say , " I don 't have a lot of security . "
Because I had to take care of what I was going to do .
If you think about it , if I think about my wife , it 's going to be better , I think ?
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And so when I first started to do this talk , it was hard to find a balance , because if I was there , you know , well , you know , well , you know , well , you know , if I was there , you know , it 's not really , it 's not really , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it 's not about me , it
But the worst thing about this is that , in a way , the idea of thinking about what 's happening to us and what I think is the most powerful benefit of the future .
But I was very happy , and I was told by a man , 20 or 30 years ago , and I was able to tell you a little bit about what I was going to do , and I was going to get a little bit more about what I was going to do , and I was going to get a little bit more about what was going on .
And so , if this talk is about , I hope we can hear the power of what we know , and what we know about what 's happening to us .
Thank you .
I only need to be a little bit more than today .
Don 't say I 'm normal .
I want to tell you about my two daughters .
UNK is about 25 cents a year .
And he 's not talking about , but it 's going to take care of music , and the best talk is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
What is love ?
He 's not going to give up . He 's not going to be able to share his love .
He 's not sure , and it 's not about something .
He 's not sure the difference between religion ; it 's not true .
And when he was asked by my mother 's song , I had to remember the song that I remember , and he asked me about what was happening to us in the spirit of compassion , and it was so different .
UNK is at age , and it 's very hard .
He 's got a lot of memory .
But the memory is there .
And he didn 't remember that , but I remember my daughter 's book , and I remember , when I was about my iPhone , I was about to tell you about the first time that I was at the top of the street in my hand , and my UNK birthday .
It sounds beautiful ?
But that 's not true for many people .
And the fact is , it 's because they 're not quite normal people , they 're smart , they 're smart .
But what I 'm sure is that even though , it 's not as though that it 's not as if it 's just going to be , it 's not just about it , but it 's not that it 's all about us , but it 's not so much .
Some of you may not know , well , this is not a UNK brain , but it 's a social social engineer that 's going to be able to move around the brain .
And every one of those cases is that it 's not unique , so it 's different . It 's different .
In the world , two , three minutes , and there 's a new kind of disease that 's going on , and it 's the fastest disease that we don 't know , but we don 't know that it 's because of the disease and the disease that we don 't know .
And I remember the first time that the word " UNK " and " I don 't know , " but I don 't know . "
When I was three years old , I was very excited about my family , and I had a whole new home .
And in a few months , I realized that he was different .
And he was very curious .
He doesn 't want to be like that , but he 's not really interested in this way , but it 's kind of like me a little bit more about me .
UNK UNK himself in his own world , and he was able to take care of his own stuff , like a man on his head , and he was able to eat the same size of his head , and the whole thing that 's going on is the same size that he 's going to eat with is the same size of his laptop , which is what it looks like .
And when he grew older , he was able to move more and more and more and more UNK than any other species .
And by the time , there was a very strong trend , and it was a little bit more than , but he didn 't know that he was a UNK person .
It 's not very easy .
I was not sure , but I was asked by my family , and I asked them to join me a little bit .
But what I wanted to do was to teach them to their stories , and we realized that these things were going to be more likely to me , and I wanted to say to myself , " I 'm not going to do this kind of thing . "
And the normal thing is that it 's not just the good news that it 's about , it 's the wrong thing to do .
Just to say , " It 's different . "
I just want to say a little bit about what you want to say to you about it .
You can be a very long person .
And whether it 's not about the difference between us -- we all have a whole bunch of people that we all have , and that 's what makes a difference .
It 's more likely to change and change , and it 's possible for us to remember that it 's going to be hard to make it happen for us .
Don 't say , " I 'm normal . "
Thank you .
The love of love , which is a picture of the picture , which is a million times a day , and the picture of this picture is just one percent of the time .
But now , for example , we can step up a million times , and it 's not only about 10 percent , or 100 percent , and it 's about the same size of the world .
Now , I 'm going to show you a new picture of the brain , which is a technology , and it 's a technology that 's going to move into this shape .
And so , with this technology , we can see the camera on the camera , and you can see that there 's going to be a visual camera that we can see , and it 's kind of like us to look at the scale of the camera .
Now , if I use a UNK , and it 's about three seconds , and it 's a little bit easier , and it 's just like a light of light , like a UNK , which is a million times larger , and it 's a bit more than a million size .
Now , if you put this together , these particles are coming into this bottle , where are the lights going to get into the sand ?
What 's the speed of the light ?
Now , the whole thing is ...
Now , remember , you know , this whole thing happened -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
But you know , you know , it doesn 't give up this experiment .
Now , there 's a couple of things going on here , so let me do this .
Now , the light comes into the bottle , which is our UNK , UNK , and it 's starting to open up .
Some light comes out , and you get into the table , so you start to see these waves .
A lot of light shows that , and you know , it 's about four months later .
You can see , here is a UNK , where it 's on the surface .
And at the same time , you see the table , and you can see it on top of the top , but you can see that in a couple of days , you can see that in a couple of days , you can see that , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you 're going to see a couple of things , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you know , sort of , you 're going to
Now , if you 're in the same way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how
One day , a week ago , a year .
Now , of course , it 's pretty boring , it 's kind of cool .
But how are we going to do this ?
You can see it on the table , it 's a UNK and a UNK .
It 's like the surface of water on the water .
And I think , that 's what makes a difference between the surface of what 's happening , but when you see it , you see the structure of the whole body .
But if you 're looking at this , you know , when you 're looking at this screen , you 're going to see , it 's not going to happen ; it doesn 't change .
Why ? Because it was a little bit , and it was about , in fact , it was a little bit later .
And so , in the future , when you get a camera in your hand , you can go to the city and you can 't see it .
So , how was I going to do this in a while ?
Now , as a movie , you know , if you want to take a UNK , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And so what we did is , we put it into a couple of times , and it was fine , and people said , " We 're going to make a picture , and this is what it looks like .
And we put all of these things together , and it was quite interesting .
Now , it 's going to fly .
Some other heroes are dead , but you can see the future of the future , and you can see the things that he 's going to see .
And this is how we can put it up .
These light will be back into the room , and some people would come back , and then you get into a camera , so we can use these light .
It 's not a movie . We really did it .
On the left side , you see the plane that we see .
In the walls , there 's an individual model that we 're going to move through .
And so , in our words , this is what we published in nature , and it was diagnosed with natural networks , and they created this painting .
And we 're going to take this wall , and it 's going to take care of the way , and it 's going to take a lot of attention , and , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And because we have a UNK camera , which is what we 're going to do , and the camera is there are some other possibilities .
It 's a good time , and it can be used by measuring the world .
And so , we didn 't know what to do with the opportunity to see what was happening , but we didn 't know what was going on .
So , we can take a picture of the picture , which is , you know , lots of , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
How can we see it ?
This is our model .
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
But of course , by the way that it 's going to be , by the way , it 's hard to do so , so we want to figure out what 's going on in the same way , so the technology that we want to do is to develop a new model for the next generation of health and health in the future .
Now , as a scientist , a scientist , a scientist , and I realized that we were able to take a lot of art , and it was a new idea , and it was a new idea , and we looked at it , and we looked at it , and we looked at them , and we looked at them , and it was just about a couple of billion years ago .
But there are interesting things happening happening .
And when you see these neurons , they 're on us .
But this is where we need to move .
What happened ?
And it turns out , because we 're able to walk through these things , we have some amazing phenomena , and Einstein 's going to see these images .
And as a result of this , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And so it 's not as important as it is , by the way , but as a result of the way , and the way it comes into our network , and we really hope that it 's going to be the case , and the idea that we don 't want to get to be more than the other side of this , and then we start to focus on the other side of the technology .
It 's time . Thank you .
This is the place where I live here , Kenya , on the South Pole .
When I was my father , my father 's father 's house was a UNK of Russia .
The South Pole , the South Pole has no influence , and it 's not going to be able to move out of this kind of thing that looks like it 's going to move around , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's going to move around the park , and it 's
So that 's the kind of UNK that we 're going to do with them , and that 's what they do .
They killed our family .
And that 's one of the things that was killed when the night was killed , and I noticed that it was dead , because I was one of my family 's office .
The people believed that we were able to put our animals together and put them in a day , and you know , well , why would we care about them ?
And so I moved into a completely different kind of love .
The Greeks were people who were willing to protect our family and our neighbors , but they were very interested in this question .
And so they decided to eat these lions .
This is one of them in Iraq , and one of them is about 10 percent of them .
And I think that 's the case for example that 's not going to be a little bit more than that .
And in our family , it was six years of a man 's father who lived with his parents , and the same thing happened in me .
And so I had to find a solution to this problem .
The first thing I wanted to do was to use it , because I know that the teachers are busy .
But I realized that this didn 't make any difference , but it helped us to see what we see .
But I didn 't leave it . I was scared .
Now , there 's a second alternative : there 's a second set of people .
And I wanted to test them a little bit , and I was standing there .
But it was smart .
And the first day , they saw a man , and then it was back , but the second day , but the second day , they would come and said , " This thing is never possible , he 's on this . "
And so they took off . They died of animals .
And one night , I took my hand on the machine , and my wife didn 't come out .
And I started to realize that the kids would be able to move away .
And so I had an idea .
Because I was a kid , and I was able to put it in a day of my house , and I didn 't know if I was a UNK , and I was hungry , and I learned a lot about how I learned about the electronics .
And so I found a UNK , a UNK , which is a little bit of a little bit of a robot that 's going to take the car to the car , and you can get the lights out of the car .
And I found a way to control the future .
UNK comes from a UNK machine .
All right , all right .
And so , as you can see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to have to put it on a battery , you know , you can put it into the machine , I put it into the system .
That 's what it 's like to do .
You can see , the robot is here , because the teachers are coming from .
Now , when lions are at night , it looks like this .
And that 's the light that 's going to be used to be a designer 's book , because I think it 's on my side , but now I 'm going to do something about it .
Thank you .
And I took this device two years ago , and it was , by the time , where we didn 't have a UNK in the room .
My neighbors , I heard about this idea .
One of them is that this guy 's a UNK .
Her father 's house was killed by his mother , and she asked me how to put her in the house .
And I heard a lot .
I put these lights on the street , and you can see it here , these are UNK .
And so I think we have about seven families in our community , and it 's very useful .
Now , my approach is now being used by the same as I did , and it was used by people , like the size of the United States , and it was used by the size of the size of the size of the size of the city .
And I was lucky because it was going to take a university school , and this is the best school in Kenya , UNK , and I was very excited about this .
And my new school here are now , and help me to give me a lot more money .
I even asked my friends back home to my community , and I was teaching them to work with them .
A year ago , I was a man who 's a UNK boy who 's a UNK kid , and I 'm going to show you a couple of times , and I 'll be there .
Now , today , I did .
And I got a chance to TED . This is my first time .
And so my name 's dream is : When I grew up , I grew up a plane .
And I was talking to this , but now , it was because I was asked to save my father and my father , and we finally went to the orchestra and the public .
Thank you very much . I mean , I mean . I mean , you know . Thank you very much .
UNK UNK : You can 't believe that this story is going to happen .
So you 've got to take a Ph.D. . UNK UNK : Yes .
Have you ever been able to do a laptop ?
What do you do ?
DR : So my next project , I want to build a UNK .
DR : I know , a movie is about it , but I just wanted to make myself one of my own .
RB : You 've tried to do that , right , but you -- oh , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
It 's a UNK . It 's a UNK . You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
We 're going to give you a little bit of this , friend , friend .
Thank you . Thank you .
I was living in Los Angeles .
And this is the UNK : UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK land .
So , the idea of the city of the city is that they sat into the name of the name of the name , so they gave it a difference between the city of the city , and it 's going to change that it 's really important to make this city .
This is South Los Angeles .
UNK , UNK , UNK land .
And with about 50 percent of the United States , I was living in food , and I lived in the middle of my food system , and I was asked by the UNK of the UNK , the UNK of the car .
The interesting thing is that it 's going to take more than 50 percent .
In Los Angeles , people died of disease .
So , for example , I live in a UNK in the streets of my street , and we 're about 10 times a day , and it 's almost eight times .
And I kind of believe these reality .
And I was thinking , why don 't you feel what you 're going to do , if you want to be able to do it , you know , you know , you know , if you 're in your community , what do you feel about when you 're in your community ?
And I see a wheelchair like a UNK car .
I see UNK UNK like this .
I don 't think so .
And I think the answer is there .
The food is the problem : food is the solution .
Again , I was able to take about 40 minutes of UNK to buy 40 cents .
And so I did that in my house , in my house .
And it 's about the green line that we call ourselves .
Five feet is 10 feet long .
The green line is all about the government .
But there 's always going to be there .
And I thought , " That 's great ! This is my responsibility . I want to make sure what I can do . "
This is why I want to give it the reason .
And so , my team and my team , " UNK UNK , " and we put together together in the same way that we were starting to start , and the trees , and there was a whole bunch of vegetables .
We 're a free organization , and we 're all about different cities , and all of us are volunteers , and everything we do .
It 's very beautiful .
But a lot of people came out .
And by the government , I gave me a story to tell me about my UNK , and then change the police .
I thought , " What 's going on ?
I mean , there are a couple of things that they can 't eat with them .
And I thought , " UNK , like that . "
Because it didn 't happen .
And so it took a long story , and it was about a story on his story , and it was created by a group of paper , and it was asked by a group of people , and it was done for about 10 months , and we succeeded .
We need to be successful in our hands .
And by the way , you know , there 's a lot of other things that I think that 's what we do .
I mean , of course , how could they do that ?
And the amount of space is that it 's about the size of the size of the United States .
It has about 25 square kilometers of space .
That 's 20 pages in the middle .
And there 's plenty of space , and there are about 35 million neurons .
Now , why do they care about this ?
There 's a tree that 's going to be about 10 or less , and maybe a couple of things .
It 's about 25 percent of the size of the size that you 're going to give you about 25 dollars .
This is my faith , and I tell people , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
It 's about food that it 's about to be used for money .
You know , now , I got a UNK in Los Angeles .
I grew up there , and I was there with my son .
And so I became part of the fact that I was being part of this reality that I was going to be able to create my own reality .
You see , I 'm a scientist .
The whole thing is my UNK , and I create my own art .
It 's like UNK artists , and they 're the size of the size of neurons , and the green line , green and green .
I put it on the floor and the city , and the plants and the trees are the ones I was on the street .
You might be able to see what 's going on , if you put it on it .
You can 't imagine a lot of joy , and it 's going to affect all of us .
What 's going to happen ?
And so I looked at my UNK , and became a tool for my community .
In order to change the communities , you have to change the city .
We 're the land .
You would be happy for kids for kids .
The idea is the most important thing about the body health and the activity of the body and the activity of the body .
And again , again , you can give up .
And I remember , a woman and a girl and her daughter lived in a day of about 10 minutes , and when I was about my garden , I was really afraid to see them , and I was very hard to see that , and I got to see them , and I was very hard to see them .
And by the way , they make me feel bad , and I tell them , you don 't like to eat food .
This is the size of the street on the street .
And when I see the people on my side , this is what I think is very strange -- and people asked me , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Hey , you know , you know , you know , you know
And I said , " No , no , I 'm afraid of people .
And that 's why it 's in the street .
And that 's what I wanted .
I want people to take it , but I also want people to change the body . "
And once again , when I was a UNK in Los Angeles , I was a UNK .
These little girls helped me .
It 's very cool , and they share about how much it 's about how to improve and what they want to do with their own parents , and you can change it in a very strong way , but that 's what it 's about to do .
The green line is starting to be about 20 percent .
We have about about 50 people and people , and they 're all volunteers .
And if kids are hungry , kids are going to eat .
You know , when they do , they would eat it .
But when they didn 't exist today , if they didn 't care about the idea of food and body , they were just about the idea of food that 's going on inside them .
And I see young people who wanted to work , but they were happy to me , and I saw a different child , and I saw these different kids , and they didn 't know what to do with them .
And when it was done , I found a chance to learn about these kids , and we can take care of our communities to make them happen .
And when we do that , you know , we 're not going to .
UNK is the next chapter of Washington .
But if we don 't really do that , we will never do that .
And so this is one of my favorites . This is what I want to do .
I 'd like to put a whole bunch of my streets on the street , and we would like to share food .
And I wanted to put it on the coffee list .
Don 't make it happen .
I didn 't want to give up , because free is not sustainable .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you have to give up .
And I was talking to people about people , and we asked them to go to the street , and put them into their own food and UNK and UNK markets .
And what I wanted to do was to try to make more of this plan about this plan .
I wanted that we were going to be the UNK of the environment , and the poor people are coming out of poverty .
We need to change the behavior of the people .
If you 're not a chance , you 're not a UNK .
How do you make a drug attack ?
Let 's give you a sense of how you choose your choice .
Basically , if you think about it , if you want to play it , you want to give me a little bit about the street .
And if you want to take me a little bit of this , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Tell you . Thank you .
Thank you .
I was a UNK , and I was the New Yorker , and I was going to go to New York City to New York City .
We make ourselves and we die .
We were waiting on a black hole on a black hole , and it didn 't have a window , it was about UNK light .
And the idea that we were able to do was to take a little bit of the object on the list of the perfect brain , and we were going to be able to put up on the media , but we were actually able to figure out to figure out how to look at it , and it was kind of like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
I 'm at the same time , and I 'm going to show you all about the rest of the house , and I see it on the front page .
And after a while , I was asked by a group of people who were asked , " UNK , " and " UNK , " and it was about to move away from the city , just to try to save his activity in a few days .
And I was really curious with others , and I didn 't know if we could , and I decided to ask them to save their lives in three weeks .
I was five years old , and I came out to meet a couple of weeks .
And that was a small UNK , and it 's about 50 percent , and it 's the first place where it 's the first UNK place .
The average girl in the morning is about 25 percent of the time , and there 's about 25 miles of land .
You can imagine , this is the size of UNK .
We launched the UNK and the bacteria .
We can help the schools and the UNK in the room , to the UNK , to the new , and to the new .
And we did lots of thousands of people on the street , and UNK are the ones that live in the local region .
We become more vulnerable to ourselves , but we are grateful .
And by the way , all the volunteers and the people we found , and we found some sort of thing .
And so they 're starting to see the images and the world and the neurons and the neurons .
And everybody 's got a car and motion together .
And so they took these pictures , and put them together , put them in the town .
Now , when I realized that , I realized that there was a huge amount of people that killed these people .
And when they felt about it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And I was in the last couple of days , and I found myself a social connection .
Help me to help the city of the community to the city of the city .
You know , it 's not going to take the picture of the people in the room .
And people took the picture of the picture , and when I was lucky enough , I was lucky enough to make sure that I was going to be able to figure out what to do .
And I was really grateful for that , and I was really grateful to say , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And when I look at the pictures , there are many other things that I can do , and I can 't even put them into a UNK picture , and I can put them in , and I think most people will help them make these pictures .
And so , when the first night , I was going to show you a few words on the Internet , and it was about two weeks , and it said , I know , we should try to move up .
And so we started doing this .
It 's a picture of a picture .
Now , it 's not a big deal , but it 's not very clear that it 's not about the size of a man 's face , and we have to UNK it down to make it work .
Otherwise , you know , UNK 's face is not going to look like her face -- that 's all the way , it 's not just about the camera .
And so , a lot of times , by the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Two weeks , I got about 50 percent volunteers , and they were willing to give up to us .
With seven weeks , it 's got the same amount of land that we have , and it 's about to be able to grow up , and it 's about , it 's about , it 's about the region where it 's going to take place , and it 's about to be able to make it happen .
Every week , we 're all going to scan the police , and people came to see their photographs .
And sometimes , a couple of years , a couple of years ago , women could take care of them , and put them in a minute , and then it would take a picture of what 's going on , and you can put it into the other side of the Earth , and you can start to move into the other side of the Earth , and you can start to move into the other side of the Earth , and you can start to move into the other side of the Earth .
But , then , of course , they needed to take these pictures , and then , of course , you know , this is what 's going on .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you need to take a couple of weeks to get a couple of weeks .
It 's even more than a month .
You know , it 's beautiful and it 's got to move around , or a little bit of the color , to move away the color of the environment , put it into the environment .
And the whole process is pretty much .
All of these things that we 've been able to do with the water Sea , which is at the bottom of the water , is that it 's not going to be a part of what 's going on in the air , so it 's sort of an important part of this project , so it 's a very important part of this project .
And if these pictures are not good , and we 're not going to put it in , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you have
Our hand was very popular .
And there was a woman who was asked us .
These images are easy to take away .
And as I was invited to say , this is what it was like in the audience .
You can 't see anything . It 's going to be a mess .
And that gave us these pictures of women , like these pictures .
And she was starting to take a picture of the street , and when she realized that she felt she was able to make a difference to make a difference .
Now , for example , she 's got a picture .
Otherwise , you know , her head on the face of her face has changed , and we found all of the images in this case , and you can make it work .
And when she 's going to give us a picture , she brought us to a story about images .
And her picture of these pictures , her , in her husband , was discovered , and there was just a couple of other people , and there was people that were coming up to him , and they said to him , what 's happening here ?
The size of the ocean is that , he 's responsible for the price of the game .
And when the police hit the door , he had to put up all the time .
She 's two of them , and he 's gone , and he 's got a school in two different schools .
And one of the kids in the school have gone down .
She spent about the whole week , and he was dead , when they died .
We also asked her to give me a little bit about the size of her son ?
For her , for example , in his mind , for example , in his case , these images , these images , and the stories , and , you know , it 's not about two or a half years , and it turns out that , in fact , that 's what 's going on in his life , or in the case of his life , is that it 's not being done .
And in the same six months , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , there 's about 10
And most of them get back to mind , and it 's very important .
You know , 50 percent of the world 's population will allow us to figure out how far from 10 percent of the city 's image of the city , and it 's all of them .
And in this period , we didn 't have a chance of being able to use a million or a million dollars a day .
We were so close to see .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you guys have some people , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And it helped us understand the way that we want to bring back to us , and it 's the most important thing that we think , but we wanted to figure out what was going on in the morning , but we wanted to figure out what was going on .
And this is the whole , and it 's about the size of the human being , and you know , by the way , you know , by the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And when you see a picture like this , it 's going to take a different difference , and it 's going to make a difference .
And this project has changed for us as well .
And for some reason , this experience made a lot of attention to them , and it 's going to take a lot of attention , and it 's not only about the size of the body , but it 's not about the size of what it 's like to be the perfect body and use it to be perfect enough .
I 'd like to read a book about a book called UNK , and I got one of these , four years ago , six months later , six months later .
And I didn 't want to take a picture of what I was doing , and I didn 't want to see one of these things that I was interested in .
And especially a woman , a young woman , a child , a child , and she 's got a little bit of a UNK , because I had a picture of my grandmother 's daughter , my grandmother , my sister , my sister , my daughter , my daughter , my daughter , my daughter 's house on my house .
Now , it 's about global warming all the time , and we have some basic needs , and it 's not , isn 't it ?
Thank you .
And today , I want to talk to you about this problem , and this is the answer .
And what I 'd like to say to you about is a secret 's secret , and I 'm going to ask you , " How long do you know that she 's going to come from ? "
" How would someone want to be a man with a man who 's going to move on ? "
I 'm not a UNK doctor , or social people , not a family of violence .
I 'm just a woman who 's going to talk about women .
I was 23 years old , and I was asked by my UNK .
And I moved to New York , and I started my first job , and the first job was , " UNK UNK and UNK . "
And I was born with my own house , and one of the first things that I did was I had a very strong secret .
And the secret to this secret is that I was diagnosed with my soul , and I was asked by this sort of man that was sort of like the UNK of my brain , and it was so many , many times , I was really , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And I was so grateful that I was one of my favorites , who was hungry , and I didn 't remember how many times I did .
Now , I 'm talking about a story that 's not an amazing story , but it 's a million women , and there 's about a million people who will walk into this position .
And maybe , it 's in your head .
I see that it 's not just a typical family who 's suffering from violence .
And I took a Ph.D. from my Ph.D. School , and I got a call from the University of UNK in UNK .
And most of my time , I was asked by a UNK company called UNK , UNK and UNK .
I was asked by my second one of my second year . I was about three kids .
I took a black UNK , a UNK UNK .
And that 's the first thing I 'm going to tell you about is : How many violence would happen in every case of your family and information and education .
It 's everywhere .
The second thing I 'd like to tell you about is that many people think that your family 's life is about women 's issues .
No .
UNK percent of the population is a male , and it 's also about , by the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
I didn 't want to put it on the world where I was going to continue to live on the other side of the world , but in fact , I was very interested in this age .
I was 25 years old , and at the same time in the United States , 16 women in the United States , and at the same time , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , women , women , women , women , women , women , who were women , women , who were women , women , who were born , who were born of her friends , or the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband ,
I 'm a very , very typical person , because I 'm a UNK and a model of violence .
I met in a UNK town , and it was a great day , a day .
We sat on the street in New York , and he was waiting for me .
And he told me two things .
The first one was that he was working on the UNK Institute , and it worked in a very good way .
But the first thing about my first show is that it 's his UNK and UNK , and he 's going to look like a UNK boy .
His face his face looks like a little bit more about the size of the size of a UNK .
And the most important thing about this is that , by the way , you know , you know , this is what I believe in this situation that I 'm passionate about .
And especially when he was told me , he felt that I was a UNK of him .
And so , I was starting to talk about what I was talking about , as I was talking about my passion , I was about to give you a little bit more about what was going on , and I gave my job to my job .
He was willing to understand my family , my childhood , my wish .
The health care about anything , and I was a woman , a woman , a man , a man who was never going to be there .
And by the way , he didn 't know , he didn 't know , but he told me that he was going to take care of his life on his face , and he was told that he was going to work on the side of his life , and when he died , he spent about 20 years of his life on his life .
And that was why he was a great philosopher , and I was working on the street , and I was thinking about what was going on .
And if I was told that to me , it was about me to tell me a little bit about my man , and I was able to do anything , and I was going to be able to talk to you about this , because I was able to tell you a little bit about what was going on in my neighborhood or trying to control or control or control .
And I didn 't know , but it was the first step between the patient and the victims of the family .
I didn 't know , but the second is UNK .
And by the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And , in fact , when he was about to give his work , he said , " He 's going to take me , and he 's not going to take me a UNK , and he wants to leave the city of the city , and he wants to take care of the size of New York City and into the size of New York City , and it 's about new lives in the same way that I was starting to start with new new lives in the city of New York City , and I was going to start a new life on the street in New York City , and I was starting to start a new life on the street .
And then , my most important thing about this is that I wanted to leave New York , because I wanted to be a UNK , and so I wanted to do something about it , so I thought to myself , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
I thought I 'd have a crazy passion for myself , and I didn 't know what I was talking about , and what I was seeing , was the control of the body and the body and the freedom of the body .
The third element of the family model is that it starts to be used by violence or violence .
And this is what I did .
We just moved to New York to New York City -- I think , health should be here -- and he 's got one of them .
There 's a UNK in the middle of the car .
We put it on top of the forest , and the third one is actually going to be in the middle .
He said , when he was young , he felt that he needed to be able to use this .
Let 's take care of his own lives .
And I said to be an obvious example , and even though it didn 't take me back to me , I was not going to be able to live on the edge of the crisis .
The first time that I was at the age of my grandmother was about five days ago .
I was 17 . I was wearing dinner .
And I was able to do a lot of work in my head , because I was a little bit of my passion , and when I was a bit of my passion , I was able to put my breath on my head , and when I was hungry , I was able to put my breath on my head on my head , and he was going to move my head on my head on my head .
Five hours later , the man on the top , I was on my mother 's daughter , she gave him his daughter 's daughter .
And even though that 's true , I still believe that we can happiness lives , because we are so grateful .
And he saw the magic of his passion .
He was just a man who was obsessed with his wife and my family and my family .
It 's a UNK , and it 's not going to hurt me .
I was just two years old .
And the first time , my first day , I moved on the door of the car , and I stopped my head , and I was on the street with my hair , and it was going to take my head off the wall to the front of my head .
And by the time , he didn 't move his car to the car , and he gave him a UNK and he put a UNK UNK on my face .
I was about two and a half years ago in my country , and every time I would have been about two .
I was told that I had one of these people .
And in fact , there are a couple of American women , and there are a lot of people who are dying of violence or violence , and you know , 50 million children have been killed , 15 million .
So , in fact , I 'm not an example .
And my question is , why am I going ?
It 's very simple .
I didn 't know who he was .
And even though I was able to put my hand on my head on my UNK , and we put them on a UNK , and I said , you know , you know , I never thought I 'd never thought of myself as a UNK kid .
And the good idea , I was a very strong man , and I was part of this guy , who was one of the other men in the world that I wanted to help .
The other question I wanted to ask was , why was she left ?
I don 't have a chance . I have a chance of opportunity .
And for me , it 's about people that people ask , well , you know , you know , you know , but we can 't be able to understand what 's going on , but we 're afraid that we know that there 's a lot of danger there .
Because the last thing that 's happened is that the last step of this is to kill her .
More than seven percent of his family lives were killed by the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims , because the police had no idea .
And yet , by the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , when you 're not going to be
Now we still have to ask , why isn 't it ?
And so I decided to leave the door , because the last time that was the last time that was the case of violence that was broken .
And I realized that if I wasn 't depressed , this was what I was going to die of love .
And so I broke my UNK .
And I was asked by all of you from the police , and my friend , my friend , my friend , my friend and family , I was standing there , because everyone was going to help me .
We tend to be able to identify the victims of the victims , and the women , like new theories .
" Why are she going ? "
Some people are saying , " It 's about her , " and it 's kind of UNK and UNK , and it 's kind of funny .
And so , in a book , a lot of people 's books , a lot of people told me about their stories , and they were starting to know what was going on -- first of all , UNK and mother , like I was born , and my mother and my life , and my mother and his sister , like , as I was born , was going to be the violence of my life .
And in fact , I 'm a model of an example of violence , and it 's a typical family UNK .
I got three kids and three girls and three girls .
I took a black UNK , a UNK UNK .
And I was never going to be able to put it on my head , and it was a good idea that I was going to put my head on my head .
And so , you might be thinking , well , you know , music , you know , UNK , you know , UNK , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
I 'm sure , you know , there are some people that I tell you about who I 'm talking about , or at least once , or when you 're a lawyer or you 're a member or you 're a member or you 're a UNK .
UNK might be in your daughter 's house , in your sister , your best friend .
And I was able to leave the story of the UNK of suffering , which was the UNK .
I still live there today .
And this is what I helped to help , and the rest of my family , is the same way that I asked you about .
Let me tell you what you see .
It 's about to live on a UNK .
You have to be able to move your family into a UNK planet .
We love each other 's helping each other .
And we need you all of a secret to your family .
You know , your kids , your colleagues , your friends , your friends and talk to this talk , you know , you know , you 're going to talk to it , you know ?
Help us to improve people 's lives , or love , to create a future .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Let 's bring it up , let 's have our own food and family and family , and we need to be able to be healthy and UNK .
Thank you .
And when I was a kid , I think my country was the best for the world , and I was going to learn a song called " The UNK . "
I don 't think so much about it .
And in school , we used a lot of time to learn how much it 's going to be , but we never had a lot of attention to know about the United States and the United States .
And I was very surprised to see the world , and I thought that I was going to be able to make a difference with my life .
When I was seven years old , my first thought about this , but I think I grew up with my life .
My family didn 't have a poor place , and I said , well , I 've never felt a experience about how to do that .
But in 1995 , my mother took a letter home to her family 's family .
And I talked about this , when I read about this guy , five of us were going to die , because we were all about two weeks .
We now live on the floor , and we live our bodies , and we are going to die . "
I was pretty surprised .
And that was the first time that I heard about the people that lived in my country .
And after that , when I was a UNK , I saw a very sad thing about this .
A woman 's woman was at the same time , and the child was a man 's child , and he was just hoping that he was hoping to live his life 's face of his mother 's face .
But nobody helped them , because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're never going to
In the early ' 80s , there was a really bad risk to this .
Unfortunately , a million of us died of UNK , and a lot of people died of UNK and trees .
And by the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
I often think of why they have lights and we didn 't .
This is a UNK map , by the way around the night of the night and the other country .
This is a part of a duck and a part of the size of China and North Korea .
And so , as you can see , it 's also very obvious to go to China to China .
But a lot of them died .
And sometimes I see a UNK on the water .
And I couldn 't leave a lot of my brain , but I would only say it was the most important year , and I was invited to my country .
I thought that I was a bit of my family .
But I didn 't think it was going to be about 40 years .
And in China , I became a UNK girl .
And I didn 't know , because I was born by a man who was born with a man 's life , but I was happy to realize that it was not just going to be a UNK , but it was a civil war in China .
And so I was always alive , and I was afraid of my identity , and I was shocked by my identity , and I would be surprised by what was going on .
And one day , my worst passion , I was born , and I was asked by a police police police police police .
I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
I was really afraid that I felt that I was really depressed .
And if there was any time , I would go back and go back .
And I thought that I was done by my wife , and it was , by the way , I was trying to make the fear of my own mind and ask them to ask their questions .
And so , a police said a word said , " UNK is wrong .
She 's not a UNK . "
And they brought me back . It was a miracle .
Some of those people live in China in China to China , but a lot of people came to jail , and he was sent back to UNK .
These girls are lucky .
And even though they were caught , it was a huge amount of international theory , and it was finally released .
But there are some other people that are not so lucky .
Every year , a few years later , a few years later , a UNK has been taken into the middle of the country , and you know , UNK and UNK were being tried .
And even though I was lucky enough , I was able to leave a lot of my life with a lot of support .
And this is a very sad fact , which is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And even though they learn about it , they found the whole world , and the whole world will move around .
And that 's why , in the past , you know , 10 years later , I decided to take a risk to go into the country , and I started to make new lives .
In the U.K. , it 's more difficult to imagine , and it 's a challenge of challenges .
The English language was important , so I had to learn three words -- English .
And so , I realized , there was a huge difference between the United States and the North Pole .
And even though we were all UNK , but we had a very different difference , about six percent of them .
I was even more proud of my own identity .
Now , what I 'm here is I 'm a UNK guy .
Where are I ? I 'm there ?
Suddenly , I would not be proud of a country as a country for my own country .
And it was not easy to do , but it was not a matter , but I was asked by the way .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you learn
And so I started to learn about the new revolution , and I got a fantastic phone call .
The UNK government gave me a part of my home home , and it was kind of like , you know , my family 's got to be part of the village .
They had to move quickly , so I started to make help them .
The way people will be able to leave from the street is that it 's not so bad .
You know , like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I 'm about to China , you know , I 'm about to China and get to China to China , and then I sat down into the middle of the country , and I sat down into the middle of the country , and I sat down into the middle of the country , and I sat out of the subway , and I sat out of the subway , and I sat out of the subway , and I sat out of the subway , and I sat out of the
Because my family didn 't know , so I had to help them for 200 kilometers in China .
We lived in a week a week on a week , a few times a day .
Again , we sat out of the street , and one of the Chinese UNK opened up .
He looked at each other , and started asking questions .
Because my family didn 't know , and I was afraid they would be caught .
And so when the Chinese police decided to me , I was able to leave on the house , and I was asked to tell him about this guy , and I was a UNK .
He was looking at me , but fortunately , but he believed my story .
And so this is where we came to us , but I spent a lot of UNK on the road .
And even though we did this , and my family , my family , was not going to be killed by prison .
When I gave the money to the money and my staff , my family was released , but then , by the way , they were caught .
And that was one of my greatest life .
I was asked by my family 's family , and I was hoping to be able to do this , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to have to be able to do this , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to have to make it happen , and it 's not going to work .
I spent a lot of times , and I came back , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can put them in a way , but I don 't have enough money to do it , but I don 't have enough money to do it .
I 'm going to show you a little bit more .
Now , I heard somebody asked me , " How ? "
And I was really UNK , and I was asked to ask , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And I was able to put it on a piece of paper that was never going to be a man who was told the story of a man , and I was told by all of my family that I was given to , by the way , a man who was given to his father 's name was all about what was going on .
I mean , you know , " Why are you going to help me ? "
" I 'm not going to help you , " he said .
" I 'm a man who 's going to help . "
And I realized that that was the moment of my life .
And this is an amazing woman , and I think it 's about the most important thing that I want to know , and the hope of human beings is that we need to be able to save the hope that we want to know .
Finally , you know , when I was growing up , I was on a journey , and I was on the side of the Cold War , but it was about half of war .
A lot of people died with their family , and when they came to New York , they would have a lot of money , or UNK .
And so we can communicate with the help of the international social network , for example , in the English process .
And we can also be able to put them in a way that 's going on inside the same in the same way , because we have a lot of people in the audience , and we 're going to put them in the same way that information is going to change in the ground .
I was so lucky that I got a lot of help , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you want to help people like that , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to help , you know , you want to
And I believe that you will be able to see more than a few weeks on the street in the same way , including TED to TED .
Thank you .
You might be happy with this kind of thing .
It 's a good thing , and it 's a good material , and it 's not always that it 's not going to be , but it 's about the size of the atmosphere .
There 's a lot of water on the street .
And especially , if you 're on the street , it 's not good for you .
Also , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And so , in this case , you know , if we 're going to move into the city of the city , like the road , we 're going to want to make a little bit more .
The power of the solution is to make a UNK UNK .
How many of you know that it 's about , like , a lot of plastic on the side , it 's got a little bit of water on the side , and the water goes off to the left , and it doesn 't even have the water on the left .
It 's going to be on these holes .
Because it 's got a lot of space , and it 's fine , so you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And of course , it 's also UNK , and it 's not going to happen .
And so what 's called it ? Look at this journey on the road .
And so , a little bit later , you know , a little bit more and more and more and more -- and -- I don 't just show that .
But it 's not that you can 't catch your temperature , you know , you 're not happy .
And finally , it 's going to take more and more and more .
Sometimes , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Well , he 's ready .
We have a problem , but we have a problem , but we have a solution .
And this is what you see here is a UNK .
This is UNK , like I said , there are little differences in this .
And so , by the way , it 's a combination of climate change , and it 's kind of like a UNK , if it 's UNK , if it 's a little bit , it 's going to start to end up .
And if you 're in this way , you 're going to have these materials -- which is what we see .
To solve this problem , we think about our own materials .
And if we can put this material into it , there may be a solution .
And so what we did is we took a little bit of a piece of paper that 's a little piece of paper , a little bit of a little bit , and we took these little things together .
So there 's a little bit of sand there .
You also need a camera like this , and it 's a UNK machine -- it 's made .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can put things together .
And so what we 're going to do is to put it up , put it into a UNK , you know , a little bit of a little bit of light , a little bit of a little bit of light .
I think it 's a lot easier than I 'm here to do today , and I 'm going to show you a little bit about this .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And so I took a look at this , and now you 're going to see what it looks like .
This is what it looks like today .
We have experiments that are working on this .
And so we tried a lot of things , the government looked at us , and they said , " That 's interesting , we should try . "
The government gave him a high bus to give us a UNK , and we were able to do it with a plastic test .
And that 's what we did . You see it on the experiment , but it 's not going to happen , but we know it 's going to be there .
And so we did a lot of things in this room , and I was able to test all sorts of tests in the lab .
And so we did what we did , and we got a lot of UNK , and we were able to put them in a way , and we wanted to use it to move and test them .
We can make a difference .
And in fact , in this experiment , if we were able to put a robot on this journey -- we would like to put this robot on a bus , and we would put a lot of money on the street , and we would expect it to be a lot of money .
So , the idea is , we 've created a material that 's been able to use it , and it 's got easier to do , and it 's going to be a lot of money , and it 's going to be a lot of money in a way that it 's going to be a lot easier .
You might be able to make it better .
Now , we see this . Now , a little bit of light .
And in fact , I 'm going to give you a little bit of what it looks like , you know , it 's effective .
But try and try .
See , you know , you know , you know .
Thank you .
I 'd like to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
There are about a million species in the planet .
UNK is one of the most extraordinary species in them .
Every time you see a UNK like this , and the first thing you see is , you know , some of these guys , you know , is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And I wanted to change this idea . I wanted to change a little bit more about what we needed to do , because they needed to be .
Let me tell you why .
First of all , why do they give us about that ?
18 years old , Charles UNK , and found out a lot of UNK , and he said , " These are UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK
You can 't wait for more than more of this , but you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , I 'll tell you why .
It 's been used to see -- like a man , a UNK , a UNK , a UNK .
And most recently , if you look at the news of Kenya -- the whole country 's population is being diagnosed as a kind of UNK and UNK thing -- but I want to call it a UNK .
I want to make it . You know why ?
Because the civil people would not protect the environment of nature .
You can 't cure the scale of the disease .
It 's almost no longer a day .
They 're just very far away .
And I love this . It 's a little bit better than I think .
And there are two neurons in the world .
The size of a new UNK is the size of the size of the North Pole and the size of the United States , and it 's about seven million birds , and they 're about seven times a day .
So why , for example , for example , in the case of UNK , you know , there 's a lot of important things about climate change , and they 're not going to change the environment .
UNK is one of our natural lives .
They would put water on the bottom of the body .
They were able to take all of them , and they would like to put the virus from the virus and the ability to grow and disease and disease .
And recently , most recently , it 's about 25 percent of the region , but it 's about three opportunities , and it 's a chance of disease that causes more opportunities to treat the disease .
There 's a lot of history of UNK .
And the connection between the ancient culture and the culture has its own connection .
You know , like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And in India , a man named UNK , who was a man who lived in the morning , and she was about to save his mind in the morning .
And at the same time , there are a lot of other things that are really important , and there are no UNK , and there are no materials , and so there 's a whole bunch of things that are being used by a kind of physical system .
So what about the birds are all about ?
Kenya has grown through the size of a UNK , and it 's about seven percent .
A lot of birds are killed by the virus , and it 's because of people who live in the city , and people use them to be able to feed them , and they become part of the UNK .
And in South Asia , a couple of countries came out of India , and it means that people were going to die in the early ' 60s , because they would have been about five percent of the people that were killed by the way they were killed by the cancer .
Now , it 's also about the size of the meat that has been used to be part of India and India , India has found that in the same way it 's going to affect the way that it 's going to make a difference .
Because , by the way , there 's a lot of UNK , and it 's starting to UNK the region of the region , and the patient , the patient , the patient , the vast majority of the human body , and the number of people that are being affected by this level , the number of people , the number of people , the number of people , the number of people , the number of people , the number of people , the number of people , the number of people , the number of people , the number of people , the number of individuals that are being affected by the global economy .
Kenya is going to be the largest world of the entire economy : 30 or UNK , and it 's going to be used to be UNK UNK .
And I was wrong by the time , but we should love to be able to figure out how to make a difference in the government , because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And they 're quite like the size of the birds .
In Africa , some people died of UNK , and they were able to eat and sell the needs .
What do we do ? We 're looking at these things that we 're working on on them .
And we tried to figure out how to explore the relationship between the environment and the environment of the environment .
And we found that it 's going to happen in different countries , so if it 's about the region , you 're hard to make progress .
We need to move away from the local communities .
We are working on local communities .
And so we were able to understand that they were able to figure out what was going on , and it got to feel the size of what 's going on , and what they were doing for our natural lives .
What you can do , and you can look at it , and you can write up your government and tell them , and we need to focus on people 's lives , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And when you walk into this room , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And what they did was , though , Charles Darwin said that he had changed his mind , and he saw a huge amount of activity in the air .
Kenya , the whole world , has a huge amount of UNK species that 's coming out of this wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
And we can all be able to make a lot of ways that we want to change the way you want to live alive .
And we didn 't have a lot of time to be part of our neighborhood , even though we live in the same way that we live in the same way that we live in the same way that we live in a public space .
And so , in the past few years , I tried to use a different approach , a lot of different things , and a lot of different things that were in the public space .
How many of these projects come from me in my own life , my neighbors , how much would it be ?
How are we going to have more and more and more of the people in the room ?
How are we going to be able to share it better and better from the architecture of the building that we live in ?
How much would we be able to compare our environment to our environment , and how much would we live in the same way that we live now ?
Now , I live in New Zealand , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And the reason that life is not going to be able to touch my mind is that it 's not just going to take a picture of my soul , and it 's kind of like a city where I think it 's about the city of music .
Every time I got a beer , I felt that you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
New Orleans has put the most beautiful building on the world , but also , she 's also about the largest city of the city .
And so , I was in this house , and I was thinking about how to make a better place in this community , and it changed my life .
In 2009 , I lost a person who 's got a love .
Her name was God , and I said , she was like my mother died and died , and nobody was obsessed with me .
And I thought a lot about death of death , and then I remember what I did , and it was kind of weird for me , and it was kind of weird for my life on my life .
But I was very hard to be part of this .
And I think that people are easy to easily understand what 's really important to them .
And so I took a lot of my friends in a new neighborhood , and I wanted to take a whole lot of space on it , and I 'd like to put it in a different direction , and we would like to share them as a way to share them .
And I didn 't know if anybody was interested in this experiment , but second day , the whole wall was filled with a story , and it 's got a different answer to it .
I 'd like to share with you a couple of things that 's happening there .
And I thought , " I thought I 'd be happy to be part of my life . "
" I want to walk through the country , " and I want to move forward to the rest of the country . "
" I want to take a picture of a million people . "
" I think I want to be a tree for the future . "
" I want to live life alive . "
I think she 's going to take a moment . "
" I want to become a man 's life . "
" I want to make it real . "
The future became a UNK , and the idea was that people wanted to give me a sense of what I wanted to do , and I was asked to give me a sense of what I was going to do when I was on my journey , and I wanted to give me a sense of what was happening in my space .
That 's what we believe in nature .
Let 's get a sense of what 's happening in the neighborhood .
And this is what we found , and this is what we found , and it 's about us that we need to change things that are important to change , and that 's the most important thing .
And this is my UNK , and I was able to give you a little bit of a little bit about this , and I was able to give you a little bit of this , and I was able to put it in a little bit of my community , and I was able to put it into the city of the city , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa , South Africa ,
And so these are images , if we can have an idea of what it 's like , it 's going to be a huge amount of space that 's going to happen .
And the most common thing we did is that , at the same time , was one of the other , was the connection .
And in this case , in this case , the good news is more important for us , and it 's about being more important for us to live well than anything else , and it 's going to be more important than ever before .
And we always don 't even have a conversation to talk about death , but I think that 's not the most important thing that we can do , and it 's the most powerful thing we can do .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And the public space is that it 's really important to share , but for us , it 's not only for us , but it 's not going to help us to help us make a better life better , and we 're going to be able to make a better life better than we can .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I grew up on the island of 50 meters in the neighborhood .
It 's very hard to breathe . You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And I can feel that it 's going to come out of the way that I 'm going to die from my own UNK , but at the same time , I can 't see anything else .
I heard about somebody who 's talking about the sound of a voice , but more of all , you know , it 's sort of like a UNK noise .
And by the same time , I was able to take a picture of a week , and I was on a street with a UNK of a UNK in the middle of the night , and I was able to put my UNK out of the wall , and we put them in a little bit of a UNK .
I was able to put my hand down , and I wanted to take a small part of what was going on , and he was able to move out of the air .
And when I was at the talk , I was on this talk to you about these things that were living in this kind of business , and no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ,
And I moved out to the city , and I was able to leave you with the fact that I was never going to be able to leave home one day .
And so , in the last 25 years , I 've been able to show you that in six years of the country , and I was fortunate enough to be able to find out how it was possible to be able to see what was happening in the city of the city .
And I met a lot of people , and I was told by a man named UNK UNK , who was a UNK of a group of UNK in the environment .
And we talked about slavery , and when I started talking about this , I was starting to figure out what to do , and I was told , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And in our talk , I felt that I was really bad at all , and I felt that I was not aware of what was going on by this kind of crazy idea , or something that didn 't know , but how many people didn 't know ?
And I wanted to sit on my face a couple of weeks , and I moved to see a UNK in Los Angeles , and I wanted to do anything about it .
And so , it started to be the journey of the balance of my heart system .
I was there , and I was there .
I still put them in my second year .
But this time , I was going to take the secret secret again .
You know , there are more than two million people on the planet today .
The number is , by the way , this is about two times the size of the United States .
15 years ago , a healthy price rate is about three times a year .
That 's about 50 million dollars .
But today , a whole family would be about 10 cents a day .
It 's amazing , and it 's about three billion dollars a year , and it 's about three billion dollars a year .
A lot of people who were told by the fact that many of us , the good jobs , the good jobs , the good jobs , was used by violence , and it was destroyed by violence , and it was destroyed by violence .
Today , for example , for example , it 's worth of business , but it 's about valuable value , but it 's about creating value .
It 's more likely to be more than one of the things that 's happening in the world , even though it 's all about , it 's all about it .
In India and Nigeria , I was diagnosed with the environment .
And it was kind of weird , and it was like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And so , for example , in 50 minutes , women and women , in fact , is a whole family full of the size of a man 's house , and you can see that it 's about seven feet above the street .
And by the way , it was a UNK , and it was about , by the way , it was about seven or seven hours a day .
You know , it 's not going to eat , you can 't eat it , but it doesn 't really have to be there .
And the idea of this is that it 's not going to be impossible for my camera .
You know , I had to put my hand on the door , and I put it on the floor , and it would take a lot of attention to the site , and it was about , by the way , to take a picture of what was going on , like , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of
And then , when I was back to the environment , I didn 't care about the speed of UNK UNK , but the idea of God was that I was asked , " UNK , no , no , no , no , no . "
And he explained to me that it was dangerous to me that it was dangerous for me , but for me , for those people .
I didn 't give them to help them .
I can 't give them money , and I can 't .
I 'm not the case of the country .
I think it 's possible that it 's going to be worse than that .
And I just want to give you a sense of UNK UNK , and I believe that they can do so that they can .
And I said , I had to go back to home to see this pain .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's
And the kids who were working on the street , he was about to spend a lot of money with them , put them up on the wall , UNK them on the street .
You know , it looks like a UNK thing .
How can we be able to do this in the same way , but what 's wrong with what ?
And some people didn 't even think that they were just about seven or seven times a day , but they got a lot of this .
There 's no more than one .
And if these people want to be free of the freedom of their own lives , it 's going to take care of all the house .
These people didn 't know , but they wanted to give up a UNK , and they wanted to put them on the side of the city , and they would put them in the same way , but now , it 's about us .
It 's not that we hear that when we hear about it , because the world 's most likely to say , " I 'm sorry that 's going to give me an idea of what 's going on at the same time that I 'm going to be able to give you an example of what 's going to be healthy .
You know , I was told that I was a UNK of UNK .
They brought me on a piece of paper that 's a UNK UNK .
This is not a revolution .
It 's more like a restaurant .
This is what the restaurant is about , and it 's known as you know , it 's a UNK thing .
A small amount of time , and it 's about seven percent of women and women and women , and there are about seven percent of them , and it 's not that it 's more food and it 's not going to take more food to eat it .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's
You know , you know , people in this room , women who were suffering of violence .
Remember that when I was a child , it was almost a UNK fear that I was about to be part of a UNK in this room .
And there 's only one that I was going through .
And no , no , no .
It 's not going to come out of your window .
These people are never going to be able to take care of this problem , and it 's important to know if we 're at the same time .
It 's almost less than less food and less than half of the United States .
Recently , in New York Times , there were about 30 million children who were sold by being killed by the United States .
And this is what we know , and we just don 't know .
And this is what we heard when we heard about vulnerability .
I was a village in India , and I was a UNK girl .
This is a guy called " UNK . "
That 's not the only man who 's at the top of the UNK on his father 's UNK .
And so they put it in a UNK , and you put them in a UNK , and you put it into the spinal cord , and it 's got a drug that 's got rid of these materials .
Let me tell them stories about their story .
" We don 't have freedom , " they said .
" Well , we 're hope , and maybe you can take this to the place where it 's going to take . "
For example , there are more than about 40 children who are living in the world , and it 's about 10 percent of the world 's lives .
And so , I was there , and I was going to see a man .
I see that it 's almost as a child , a little boy , a little kid , a little bit more .
Yeah . They 're about respect .
And the kids came out of the house , and it 's not going to be used to be done by the UNK , and it 's not going to happen .
This little boy is about seven years old .
And when we took a picture of our boat , he was able to put up on the boat on my boat .
He was scared of water .
So , you know , there was a UNK in Los Angeles , and the kids were going to be able to put them into the water , and the kids were killed in the water , and they were killed by the water .
Many people die .
And by the way , he was starting to work on the surface .
He was really afraid that he was never going to be used by the same way , but it was more important to what was going on in the same way that he was interested in his way .
And I saw these kids at night , and I saw these kids , and they were starting to work in the next 10 years .
In this case , UNK night .
You know , there are thousands of thousands of things that are made out of this fish .
I 'm going to show you a little bit of this .
He 's never been asked by a UNK guy .
He 's a place where he was a place called UNK UNK , which was a place that was really hard to take care of .
And so , he 's on the street , and he 's starting to put it up on a UNK , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's
And because someone 's talking about , you know , you know , it 's going to change his future , and it 's going to change the future .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And he gave us a way to change a UNK .
And by the way , they 're going to take us all the time .
And he pointed around the ground , and he said , " It 's this . It 's this . "
And we developed a little more than a small piece of the street , and a little bit of the size of a small hole that was published to me , and it wasn 't going to take me off the plane , and it was going to take a huge amount of water that was going to take a lot of hot water on my head .
You know , two hours , two hours a day , and we 're seeing this in front of the sky , and there 's a UNK where there 's a whole lot of water that 's there for every day .
A lot of women live with their little kids , and they 're being used by the water of water .
And the water is made for money .
These people are being working on the other side of the city .
And when they get out of it , it 's safe .
And I remember that they were able to put them in a small blood , and you know , there are a lot of people here .
And so , these things that were very much like this , you know , there was a whole lot of people who were able to put them into a UNK bag , and it was being used for a whole bunch of other areas .
So , you know , the idea of the street , and the human body , but we get a little bit of a little bit of a man who 's got sick and a little bit of kids .
They were all victims of violence .
And in fact , these muscles that are going to be able to do this , and it 's probably going to be able to end up with this person that he was going to work with .
This is UNK UNK . When his father died of his wife , his uncle gave him to buy his own work .
He died after he died in his UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , he was moved to work in Los Angeles .
And I saw this guy , and he was working on the age of 10 years of this , and he saw that in a while , he was trying to make a sense of what was going on at the time .
And by the same time he was sick of this disease , he also needed to be a job of what was going on in the morning .
And even better than that , he also wanted to be able to give up what was going on in UNK , and it was about , you know , it was kind of like a metaphor to imagine what I was going to do with the optimism of my mind that was kind of like that , you know , it was kind of hard to imagine , you know , kind of like that , you know , it 's kind of like me to imagine that you have to be happy to imagine .
I hope that we 're going to give this amazing light .
And so when I got a lot of light from the street , I took a lot of people with me , and I was hoping that I was hoping that I was hoping that I was hoping that I was going to take a picture of my story , and when I was there , I gave this extraordinary picture .
They know it 's going to happen .
I want them to know what we can , and what we can make them change .
And I really believe that we 're going to be able to do this as well as we can .
And it 's about the story , and it 's about , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
I didn 't want to wait for this beautiful , but it was just not going to be the people who were going to meet people .
And I hope that it 's going to be , like , you know , like that , and I hope that this is going to be more likely to be the hope of this force that 's going to be used to continue to live in a while .
Thank you .
So , I 'm a scientist , and I 'm a scientist who 's interested in a program that 's a particularly hard problem , and we 're going to be quite a bit of a way .
Nobody knows where we are .
So I 'm going to show you some examples of what we are .
Well , dancing is human beings .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , UNK and dancing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
But , unfortunately , the idea of the nervous system , like the UNK , UNK UNK , was able to take this journey on my friend , and he 's also one of my friends .
These young years , he also got a lot of support to a lot of cancer .
But , there are about 30 million people who have this disease , and they also have to feel that it 's about , and it 's going to be something that we need to focus on , and we need to figure out what to do , and we need to figure out how to move forward , and we need to figure out what to do with them .
And we need to figure out how to look at this , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
But the idea is that it 's not as much as it is , by the way , and other people , because you can 't do that , you know , the best way that you can do is we can make an example of the size of the size of this 20 minutes .
You have to get away from the clinic , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
But how many people would be able to do this ?
And that 's also going to be able to take care of the patient , and how do you treat it ?
You don 't need to spend a lot of money to buy .
And by the way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And so I want to give you a very quick idea , because you know , in a way , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
I have a video video video a little bit more .
And this is the idea of the patient 's health , which is what we call ourselves a sound of sound , because when we light up these things , it 's about us , for example , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future , for example , in terms of the future ,
And it also has to take care to learn .
You can imagine , a child said , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
From the sound of sound , we can learn from the UNK of the sound of the sound of the sound , and we can also influence our instruments .
And so you can see , in the bottom of the bottom , it 's a kind of sound of sound .
We see a whole bunch of symptoms .
UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK .
Now , you know , you would be able to change a little bit better , and then they were more likely to be healthy .
And in fact , there are many things that are really hard to do , but , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
So , these words are UNK , and they 're going to be able to interact with space , and they all have technologies .
And when you try to test the experience , you can use it .
You didn 't have to design a new medical hospital to test it .
They all have UNK . They said , but it 's not about religion , but it 's not about religion .
And that means that the patient 's going to be able to give up the patient .
It 's about 30 seconds and it 's about 30 seconds .
The price is low , and we know what to do .
And the price of the price of this is that it 's also going to be able to scale .
I have some examples of what this looks like today .
We can reduce the consequences of the patient and the patient .
You don 't have to give up .
And so we can move forward into a high scale , and you can look at the numbers .
And we can get a lot of attention to test , and it 's very much for us that we can make a number of rules , and we can do it for the first time .
We also have the opportunity to start thinking about this disease that 's happening in the epidemic .
And so , from now , you know , let 's start with this one step , and we started with UNK UNK .
And the same thing that we had to do with UNK UNK , and we wanted to know , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
Our city is going to move about 50 million people on the planet .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
Thank you .
PM : So , in fact , it 's not as if it 's a healthy person , who is a disease ?
What do you think about these things ?
Well , yes . So , so , so this is where it 's like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
You know , there are people who are not going to give us , or you can 't .
But we still get a lot of mass data from a different environment , and it 's a different environment , because we can get rid of this disease of the disease that 's happening in this disease .
So you 're going to spend about 75 percent faster ?
It 's not true .
And in fact , I had to teach him , and I had to ask him , because he was able to make a difference , and I was asked by all of these things that we had to move into this project , and now we were able to take 90 percent of the time .
Now , well , that 's great .
And so that means people can -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , well , you get a computer , and you get a voice , and you get them on , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
That 's it .
Thank you so much , UNK and UNK .
Thank you .
And I was enough enough to take a camera , and I was pretty surprised , but I wanted to share it for you , and I didn 't know it was about me .
There was no magic , there was no evidence , there was no more opportunities , there was a little bit of light .
And in fact , most of them are starting to move around the street .
My story is my story , and my wife , my wife , my wife , my wife , my wife , my daughter , my daughter , my husband 's birthday -- we 're sitting at the age of 25 and 25 and a half years ago .
And so , first , we went back to New York City , so we decided to make a picture of the same picture .
You can guess what happens .
And so , when you get married , my wife says , " Hey , you know , why don 't you like to go to New York City , and you 're going to go to New York City ?
It 's starting to take us from the way that we 're going to take care of the street .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
No , it 's not going to take off , it 's not about our camera .
Now , we didn 't know how this journey was going to change our lives .
And for us , it 's going to be quite exciting .
And this is what happened in the first few weeks , and I was trying to figure out how it was about to be about five and a half years ago .
So these pictures have not only happened a moment , or a UNK journey .
And it 's the way that we feed our way into 10 weeks , and it 's about us , and it 's about changing change in the body , and it 's going to change the change in your body , and it 's going to change the change of the body .
Because I gave them a different picture , and our vision was not going to be a new surgeon , and I was able to see her in her eyes , watching how to look at it , how to do it .
And this is our time when our kids live , and the most exciting time in our life .
The last time , we walked around , and she walked out of the street , and she looked at me a little bit of a UNK , and she said , " I mean , when she was a UNK man , she was kind of like me , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was a kid , she was starting to start with , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was about , you know , when she was
She 's about five years old , and she 's standing on the edge of this photograph .
And she said she was going to see the first first time she saw that she was going to win , and that 's what happened .
Now , she went to New York City , because she decided to go to New York .
And I suddenly realized that the most important thing we can do is our memories .
And so I want to share this kind of thinking about the idea of thinking about creativity .
And I don 't know if you know , but I do , it 's about five to 10 minutes , but I 'm not going to show you a picture .
I always want to be the guy that 's got a camera camera .
I want to encourage you all the rest of us here tonight , and you know , " Can you help us ? "
Thank you .
