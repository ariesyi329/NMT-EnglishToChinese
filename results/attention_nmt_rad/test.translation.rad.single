I was 11 years old , and I remember one day , listening to the voice .
My father was on his UNK with a UNK UNK .
And he 's obsessed with his smile , and it 's almost like most of the news that most of us do .
" UNK ! " " UNK of the UNK .
I don 't know what that means , but I can see his father 's very happy .
" You 're going to go to a real school , " he said .
I would never forget the morning .
A real school .
I was six years old , UNK UNK and UNK UNK .
And so for the next five years , my sister took me to a secret school to a secret school , and she was never going to be alone .
This is the way that we have about education .
We 're going to have a different way of doing that , and it 's not going to be able to know where we 're going to go .
We put books in the food chain , and it 's going to be that we 're just going to be able to build things .
The school is in a room , and it 's about 100 million people in this room .
It 's great , but it was great .
And we all know about ourselves , teachers , teachers , and family and family .
Sometimes , in school , there were a lot of people who stopped looking for a week , because the Soviet Union didn 't know .
We were always trying to figure out how to move .
How are we going to be here ?
How do they know about us ?
We were scared , but we didn 't really want to learn school .
I was lucky enough to grow up with a family and love family .
My grandfather was in his age , an extraordinary man .
He was born in Afghanistan , and he was involved in the same way that he was talking about his father , my mother , to go to school and to school , to his father , to his father .
But I was taught by education as a teacher .
That 's her .
Two years ago , after two years , she gave me a school , education and women and women and women .
My father -- that 's him -- he 's the first person in his family .
And so his wife was asked , when he was a child , he was diagnosed with education , and he 's got a business , he 's got a UNK , he 's got a UNK , he 's got a UNK , he 's got a UNK .
For him , child didn 't have to teach education , but it was a better risk of education .
And I remember my life when I was working at the University of the Soviet Union , and I remember that my life was going to be afraid of my life , and see if it was possible .
I want to give up , but my father 's going to say , " Listen , my daughter , you can lose anything in your life .
Your money might be killed , you might have a war on war .
You know , you know what you 're going to do is , if we don 't want to sell to the patient , and we will never do that .
But do you want to continue ? "
I 'm 25 years old .
I grew up in the country for decades of war .
I was six years old , and most of the women in the United States didn 't die , if not my family , I would like to share people like a lot of people .
And so now , I 've been a proud of a proud student at the same time .
And Aristotle , when he was in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , when I was back in the United States , my grandfather was asked by a man who was asked to teach , and I was asked by the patient .
He 's not just because my university student , because in women , I was the first one , and I was one of the first of the people that I was going to take place for the first car in his life .
My family 's very much about my family .
My dream was great , but they were even worse .
And that 's why I became a global global prize , and this is a global network of women .
And that 's why I was a leader , and it was the first thing that I was going to be able to do a little bit of a letter , because in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan , in Afghanistan .
And I thought , you know , I see my students in school , and I can put a camera on this , you know .
And so my father , my father , was the father of her father , like my father , who looked at them .
Now , for example , this is not true . I can 't let you see it ; he 's a student of mine .
And no one month , he was working with his daughter in a way that was used by the way that he was working on school .
He 's got a home , a voice with a voice , a voice of a voice , and he 's going to go back to school , and he 's going to happen next to him .
" If you think , now it 's going to kill me . " He said , " I 'm not going to leave you with the idea of the future . "
And when I realized that -- and I realized that in the West -- and I realized that the Western world didn 't realize that , and it was one of the first of our success -- he was diagnosed with his own , and his success , was his success , was his success .
It 's not about the parents who are not really important to our success .
And in fact , by the way , for girls , and most of all , for the first time , and most of all , in the history of the audience , we need to have a positive support .
You know , when I was working on the street , I was asked to school , you know , a few hundred thousand people -- you know , forget , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , when
But today , in Afghanistan , education is more than 30 million .
Afghanistan is quite different from the United States .
I found out that the United States can see our vulnerability .
And I worry about these changes that were being used for the first time in the United States .
But when I went back to Afghanistan , my students and I wanted to help them with their parents , and I saw the future of the future , and I saw this sort of thing that was going to happen to the future .
For me , Afghanistan was great for peace , and so on , each of the kids that I was asked to do was I was asked to do a lot of my kids about a UNK book .
Like , as I do , they also have a lot of dreams .
Thank you .
And all I did , I didn 't know how to live life -- the whole life of life -- my whole life of young people in Africa of Africa .
And I was young , and I was young , and I was young , and I got a lot -- I was in the United States , and I grew up on a UNK , and I found myself , like , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK in East Africa .
And when I was a UNK government , I spent a couple of them every project in Africa .
And I was obsessed .
And I think that , when I was 12 years old , we thought that people were better , we were in Africa , in Africa .
And yet , what do we do ?
The first project I wrote about my first project , and it was called " The UNK . " And in this project , we thought , " How would we want to teach people to charity ? "
And so , we took a lot of fun to the optimism , a UNK , a UNK , and we taught ourselves to be a kind of UNK and UNK UNK in the West .
And , of course , the people who are interested in this , and so we can tell them how to do that , and they 're also going to come out of this .
And it 's not so interesting that it 's not so interesting that it 's not so interesting that it 's not so interesting that we feel so much about it .
But we didn 't have asked them , and it was about , " UNK . "
I was asked by a man who was in hunger , and I was asked by a group of people . "
And of course , in Africa , it 's good for Africa .
And so we kind of UNK our buildings . And in Italy , in a way , a city has been so large , and so on , for example , it 's going to be about today .
It 's hard to believe , and we talk to people say , " Look , a lot easier . "
And when the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK ,
And we said to people , " Oh , these people die . "
People say , " Yes , that 's why we 're not there today . "
" Why don 't you ? " You know . "
And I think that the people that we really want to live in Africa , but when I know the American , the British and the French , and when I see them , I think that 's what we see in the United States that we see in the United States that we see in the United States that we see in the United States , and I think we have a very proud of what we 're doing in the United States , and when I see them , I think we see a lot of what we 're doing in the United States .
Because we eat UNK .
And you should see these UNK -- UNK -- and you can see that there 's a lot of people that we see there .
You can read a book about this book , called UNK , UNK , UNK .
This book was published in 2009 .
And so these things that we put in 50 percent of the countries around us about 50 million dollars in the last 50 years .
And I can 't just look at you , and I can 't tell you about this money .
You read about it .
Look at the eyes of Africa , a lot of what we call .
We live in Germany , and it 's about a kind of UNK , and we 're going to have a couple of them , and a bunch of them , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK .
So these words come from a company called " UNK . " " UNK . "
But the idea of two words are different .
And so my parents did that , and I put myself in different cultures , and I was asked , " I love your child . "
And I was asked to leave the rest of my life to do that .
And that 's why he 's called " UNK . "
I was reading a book about a book , and it was like , " The book is " or " or " in the book , " or " The most important , " or the most important , if people don 't want someone to want to help , and when they don 't want to leave them , you know , if they didn 't want to go to the other , if they didn 't want to put it in , you know , if you didn 't want someone to put it , you didn 't want to make it .
Now , this should be the key to support .
And the reason for aid was about respect .
And so , in the morning , it 's going to be able to show up on the screen , and say , " We can -- you can 't -- you can 't imagine , like , you know , you can imagine the city of the city of the city of a city of God ? "
And when I did a decision , I did a series of people , and I started a program , and I did a work , and I did a lot of people , and we didn 't really want to , and we didn 't really want to , and I didn 't really want to people , because the local communities of the people , and the people of the people , and the people of the people , and the people of the people who were looking at people who would find people 's lives .
So what we 're going to do is we 're going to eat .
We 're going to have a community that 's not going to be able to think about , but it 's about being connected .
Our work is not going to be .
We talked to our clients with our clients and the UNK .
We didn 't have any infrastructure to build .
And so what we do is , we talk to each other , and see what they 're interested in .
The most important thing .
You can put your hand into the street .
But if not , you know what ?
And the UNK of the UNK of the self is the most important .
The importance of the future is to build on its own infrastructure , and this is the most important thing .
And we asked them to try to figure out knowledge and information , because the world has no money and no materials .
Some people have to know about knowledge , but we can support support .
And so many years ago , I have a thought , why we can 't see more or less ideas and not just to think about our ideas , not just to think about them , but it 's not going to be a form of social justice .
I tell you about a secret .
The communities have about a problem .
People don 't know , and they 're not going to tell you , they 're not going to be able to tell you , where they 're going to put it on , and they 're going to do a lot of a lot .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
You don 't even know the people who are most aware of you , because they 're not going to share your public public .
Our approach is , by the way , to build a future , we must build a future where we need to build a future infrastructure .
We had to create a whole new career .
And in this case , in the city of entrepreneurs , and it will interact with your house in your house , or in your kitchen , or if you want to be able to put yourself in your own environment , to help you put yourself in a way that you would put yourself in your own environment , to help you put yourself in a way that you would put yourself in your own environment , to help you put yourself in a way that you would put yourself in your own environment .
I was working at the University of California in Australia .
And I was at MIT , trying to give up the patient 's arm that was going to give up on the other side of the spinal cord .
And so my first year , I was just going to go to the streets , and I got my first guy , and I got a letter from the kitchen , and I helped him , and I taught him to do that , and , " How do we go to a UNK ? " You know , do you want to sell people ? "
And I asked these five people , and it 's not just about 50 percent of the U.S. companies , but it 's about 15 dollars a day , and it 's got to say , " Hey , you know , " Hey , you know , " Hey , you know , " Hey , you help them , and you can help us ? "
In the year , I did about UNK projects , and the government came to me and said , " How do you do that ?
How can you -- " I said : " I did a very hard thing .
And that 's the way , listen to them . "
So -- and so on , the government said , " That 's going to be done . "
We 've launched about 300 communities in the world .
We helped have about 40 people .
New Yorkers were more than a business period of people who were being asked by a lot of people .
And by the time , Einstein , in the most powerful words , years ago , they died .
Now , Einstein was a UNK professor who was a professor of college , UNK UNK said , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " You know , " you know , " You know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " and
The plan was to give up .
Now , when we 're a UNK , we don 't know what the most common people want to use of their money and their staff .
We need to learn how to bring them from them .
And we had to give them information to them , and we would love to take them to help , and we would put them in , and we would get people into the water .
In one thing , in 10 communities , we have about 200 houses .
You can imagine a UNK community , a lot of community , a lot of joy and a lot of joy ?
How much are you going to talk to me ?
It 's a UNK of the city . You pay for them .
And so what I 'd like to say is , I think of the creative spirit of the social revolution .
Now , when we 're in the future of the Industrial Revolution -- we can use fuel fuel and development and development -- but we suddenly realized that this is not sustainable .
There 's almost a huge amount of fuel that we have .
And it 's not very early in the atmosphere .
What we 're asking now is , how do we make a different way of being able to grow about 100 million people , medical education , education , education and education ?
The technology of technology is not there .
Who can read that technology will happen to be the green revolution ? No one wants to do .
The government ? No .
It 's about entrepreneurs , and they 're in the future .
For many years ago , I saw an interesting article in a future .
In the ' 60s , a group of people got trained to talk about the future of the city of New York City .
That 's 16 years , and it 's about 10 years from the New York City , and they 're all about 10 years from the New York Times : 10 years from New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City , New York City .
Why ? Because they look at the surface of the surface , and if you 're going to put it into this speed , it 's going to take about 10 million , and it 's going to take about 10 million children , and it 's going to take about 10 million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and you 're going to put it in a million , and it 's
You know , people would be UNK .
And so , for example , they thought that the technology was going to kill his life in New York City .
So , in the first time , in 10 years , in 10 years , the number of people came out of the country , and it was about 10 or 50 years ago , and it was about 100 years ago .
There 's a new technology that has developed a new technology , and it 's not going to be able to take care of what it 's like , and it 's got to be a lot more than it didn 't .
For example , HIV / AIDS is the size of the future .
And yet , there 's a secret in the church of creativity .
First , you have to give them a secret .
You know , it 's not going to talk about you .
And then you want to take care of attention to them .
You want to tell them what they are .
Whether it 's not just about a company or a kid , it 's got to be able to put three things in the future , and you can put it in a lot , and you know , you know , you need to be able to take a lot of them , and you 're going to be able to take a lot of money , and you 're going to take a lot of money , and you put a lot of money , and you put a lot of money , and you put a lot of money , and you put a lot of money , and you put a lot of money , and you put a lot of money , and you put a lot of money , and you put a lot of money , you know , you know , you know , you need to take care of the market , and you 're going to have to be able to take a lot of money , and you 're going to do a lot of work , and you 're going to take a lot of money , and
What 's the problem ?
It 's not one of the people that 's ever been able to make a good job if it 's not possible for the first time that it 's going to work .
That 's not happening .
That 's what it 's about .
And we did that , in 10 years , in the World , in the world , the city of the world , the city of the world , the European Union , the company , the company , the company , the UNK company , the UNK company , the UNK company , the UNK company , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the
All the world in the world , and there 's only one in the world , and there 's no one that 's being done by one of them .
Now , when we 're in the U.K. , we 're going to do a lot of people in Oxford , and we 're starting to figure out how to make a difference at the same time , but in the same way , I think , " I 'm going to show you a little bit of a couple of them , " I said , " I think , " and this is what we call a " project , " and it 's going to be about as many times as " we " and " in the same way , " and it 's about as much as we use it " and it 's a lot of us and it 's a lot of us and it 's a lot of us , and it 's going to be about as many times as " we " and it 's about as much as we use it " and it 's a lot of us and it 's a lot of us and it 's a lot of us , and it 's kind of like a lot of times , " we 're going
" I didn 't . " We did 30 times three times .
He was just a UNK .
No one 's ever going to be a leader . No .
And so we can build a community , where we have a community that 's going to be able to make a difference between the community , and we can give you your own business , and we can ask you , " What are you going to do ?
What can you do ? How can you make it ?
Can you make it ? Are you responsible for funding ? "
" Ah , this is my other . " What 's going on for me ? "
We started talking about communities in social communities .
We have volunteers , and the people that we want to help people to help them be able to help people to change the way that people want to be able to change the way of the communities that are going to be able to change the way of the communities and the economy , but you can better be kind of going to be able to use them to be able to use the communities that are going to be able to be better , and to do this kind of sense of the way that we 're going to be able to use the communities of the community , and we need to be able to use them to do this kind of thing , and it 's going to be kind of going to be kind of going to be kind of like a good way of looking at the human body and how it 's going to be kind of going to be kind of going to be kind of going to be kind of going to be kind of a kind of way of looking at the human body and how it 's going to
Thank you .
Five years ago , I was a leader of a friend called UNK .
The National Geographic taught me about a teacher in a way to learn from a scientist who was in his way .
I was shocked .
I was really surprised . These students were having a lot of fun , and they had a lot of words , and they did it with a lot of words that I was used to use .
But when I was a child , my experience of love , by the way , through that little black hole , you see that there 's a whole lot of global world coming out of the street .
And so this is what I learned to do with my students , and I wanted them to feel that I was able to experience the experience of this experience of experience .
And I believe that the key thing about the door is that there 's good news and communication .
To change the world , we need people from our scientists and engineers , and we get a lot of communication .
Our scientists and engineers have said that the biggest problem that we have learned to do is we don 't know , and so , if we don 't understand them , and I believe that we believe that we have a lot of information that we believe in a way that scientists and other things that we can do to interact with them .
But if we look at chemistry and engineering , we don 't really want to see them in a way that we can 't be good enough to see them .
So scientists and engineers , please ask us to talk about technology .
I want to share a lot of projects that I want to tell you about how you can learn from your science and to understand that , by the way , the engineers of science .
The first one was about to answer the question : How about technology ?
Tell us , why are you interested in your science ?
And when I show you , it 's about to tell you about how it works , because the neocortex of the neocortex itself because the neocortex of the neocortex has to be very important to see the network of information and treatment .
The other thing is , when you describe the scientific theory , you need to figure out what it 's about .
Art is one of the things we know about you thinking about .
And of course , you can say , " Well , you know , when space is about , you know , " How about space time time time time time time time to say , " Well , you know , when I was talking about space time , you know , " What 's wrong with space ? "
Let 's make sure you know , it 's not that simple .
Instead , it 's very easy to say , by the way , to make it possible , it 's not so much easier .
You don 't have to change your mind , you can 't really change your vision theory .
You can imagine some examples , stories , stories , and things that we 're about to talk to you about , and let us care about what we 're excited about .
And you know , when you look at the movies , you 're going to be able to use it .
How do you think about it as a symbol like a UNK ?
So what is it about ? It 's got to kill people , and it can make your own story .
It 's not only about , like , you know , like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we don 't have to do that in a way that we don 't care about our brains , and we don 't know what we don 't know .
And so this is a picture of a picture of UNK , UNK , and it 's been great for us to take a look at the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK of the UNK .
And so the problem with this is that it 's kind of simple and smart , and it 's not going to be a little bit easier , and it 's going to be a little bit easier , and then it 's going to give us a sense of what we 're going to do , and we can make a lot of sense of what we 're going to do with what we call the content , and it 's going to take us through what we call the content , and it gives us a sense of what 's going on in the way that we describe what we call the content that we have , and we can tell you about what it 's like to be able to describe what we call the content , and we can make it better for us to describe what it 's more likely to do with the content that we call that it 's possible to describe the content that we call it .
And so these are some of the things that I think might be able to do that , and feel the good way of thinking about science and engineering and engineering .
And so I was asked by the engineers that I was taught that I was living in a way , and I wanted to end up in a way that I was going to be able to end up in a way that I wanted to end up in a way that I was interested in a way that I wanted to end up in a way that I was going to try to end up in a way that I was interested in a way that I wanted to leave my mind .
And when you look at science and you , like , you know , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to share a lot of people , and you 're going to have to share a sense of what 's happening in your life , and it 's going to be about the way that you 're about , and it 's going to be about to understand , and it 's going to be very clear , and it 's going to be quite clear , and it 's going to be very clear and it 's going to be very clear and it 's going to be very clear , and it 's going to be very clear that it 's going to be quite sure , it 's going to be very clear and it 's going to be very clear and it 's going to take place in a very different way , and it 's going to take a lot of sense , and it
And so scientists and engineers and engineers , when you know about this process , you want to do the whole way , to talk about technology .
Thank you .
And I love that word , " The word " in the whole world , called UNK .
It 's not because it sounds good .
And what it means is the government of a talk .
And even though this is a good piece of paper that he gave up a really good definition of paper , and he thought he was going to be a UNK , or any way that he was going to do anything about , or anything that was going to be better or less or less or less . "
I didn 't know what to do , " UNK UNK . "
It 's about the words of language and language , and I don 't .
But it 's really important to say that the words are really important , and all of the politicians that have helped them to try to control their own language .
For example , in the U.K. , U.K. , Britain will allow us to give up a new piece of paper as a symbol of what 's happening in the debate .
And in fact , it 's because the guy who 's here is a UNK , and it 's a great example of UNK UNK .
He was convicted of the London , but he was still a UNK of the courage , and it was going to be a little bit more powerful , and it was used by a man who was diagnosed with a lot of support from London in London .
And a few years later , we had a first record , and we said , " UNK , you know , " UNK . "
A lot of people think it 's about a lot of money .
No , it 's not about being a UNK .
But I want to tell you about real time and political thinking about how it 's happening , and I want you to go back to the United States , and it 's about to UNK them .
And when they had a problem with a question : How do you call it " UNK , " they said .
They didn 't know .
Now , why should we care about international leaders ?
And the problem with this is that it 's a long time in the country .
And it 's a lot of advice , and it 's a lot of advice .
I mean , some people want to say that he 's a UNK government , and some people say that he 's called Washington , and it 's got to say that he 's got to do a lot of a UNK government called UNK government .
There was no names of one of them .
Some people just want to call it up .
They thought it was a symbol of what was used to be used .
And they didn 't even have to UNK , and they said , " You know , if you can , in the developing world , is a UNK .
You know , it 's going to work .
And everyone 's got a good experience for a child , and it turns out , for example , it 's about three weeks a month .
And I read a poem about what was happening when he was talking about , and he said , " It 's not the case . "
And the reason for that is that it 's going to be used by the people and the UNK of the public war in the civil war .
UNK didn 't want to make a UNK .
They didn 't want to call him to be a way that he was going to be able to call it to any other person in the country .
And so they gave him an idea that they would want to be able to figure out , and the worst , most of them .
And this is called " UNK . "
And UNK thought , well , they didn 't create this , but I thought , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a
And the idea of the same way through the same way .
And it 's not obvious that it 's very , very clear that it 's called " UNK " and " UNK . "
You know , it 's got a little bit of people who have a little bit of people who have a lot of people who have a lot of them , but it 's not a real street .
And that 's why it 's about to talk to the private war .
They said that this was really , you didn 't want to call him .
This guy was going to be able to do a lot of things and see what was going on .
Who else ? If he was only a man , a man who was asked to do a lot of surgery -- is that a UNK of UNK UNK ?
And after three weeks of paper , there was no difference in the Bible .
And as a result of the way , they will take care of them , and they 're going to be able to use them to do the same thing , and it 's going to be a very different kind of , and it 's going to be a very different kind of , you know , in the same way , and it 's going to be a very different kind of , and it 's going to be a very different kind of UNK , and it 's not going to be a UNK of the size of the country , but we don 't want to see them as a different kind of way .
Now , in this case , you can see the interesting thing about three things .
First , it 's my favorite place that I was going to find that I was able to find that kind of thing that I was able to find out of the people that I could find , and I was going to talk to you about a company that was designed to say , " UNK of the public . "
George Obama , " The UNK of the president , " or " The first thing that 's happening now is that there 's no life on the edge of the road .
The second thing that you can know about that is that the American government of the United States , and it 's only about a decade ago -- it would take about 22 years .
But the first thing you can remember , and it 's important to remember , and it 's a very important thing , and the government of the government , the government , the government of the government , has never seen the idea of what 's going on , and it 's not about , isn 't it ?
And so it 's about 50 percent of the UNK of the UNK , and it 's also about the largest economy in the world , and there are other types of people around the world .
The reality and the history of this project is a huge amount of sense .
So , finally , it 's gone .
They get them to do something about it .
And one of the things that happened was when I was asked to do a little bit about this , and this was kind of weird -- well , it was quite surprising to see what it was .
But now , you know how many countries here are there ?
Seven .
And this is because they want to put their heads on their own little UNK , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc .
And so , finally , by the way , by the way , by the way , to the private sector , because no one 's ever going to be able to tell them about the fact that they were told by the fact that they were so happy to the government of the government .
And that 's really important to me , and I think that you can learn , and I want to leave you with this .
The government was used by hand , and it was used by words , and it was used by words and control , but in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in reality , in a way that we can change the words of the word " technology " and the reality of the word " the reality of the word " to change the reality of the word " and " the reality of the word " to change the reality of the word " and " the reality of the word " to change the reality .
Thank you very much .
I was sitting on a UNK , a UNK restaurant , and I was 11 years old , and I was a member of the UNK of UNK in Iraq .
And I spent a lot of my beautiful shoes , and I did a pretty nice street , and I didn 't really have a UNK in my face .
This was my first time in Afghanistan .
And when I was a friend of the World Bank , a few days ago , a lot of people on a day , a lot of people , a lot of people , a lot of people , a lot of people , a lot of people , a lot of people , a lot of people -- they didn 't know what was going on , and when it was , in fact , " UNK ! "
But that 's what it 's about .
And so I spent a lot of water in this room , and I spent a lot of my career , and I was a UNK , and I was working with a UNK artist , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the street , and I was working on the work of life , and I was going to work to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work , to work
And in Afghanistan , you can create a lot of things like art , but I want to describe how to make a difference , and I want to be able to figure out how to put a man in a way that was used as a symbol of what 's going to happen in a way that I think is quite a kind of like a visual theory of what 's happening in the future , and it 's kind of like a visual theory of what 's going to happen to us , and it 's not going to be able to make a sense of what 's going to happen in a way that 's kind of interesting for us to think about what 's going on in the future , and it 's kind of like a visual theory of what 's going to happen to us as a symbol of what 's going on in the future , and it 's kind of like a visual theory of what 's going to happen to us as a symbol of what 's going on in the future , and it 's kind of an idea of
I 'd like to share a difference with a civil war with a different kind of machine that he was wearing a UNK , and it was used by a UNK of the orchestra , and it was used by religion and political and political and political .
And so these challenges , by the way , to the public , to the public , to me , to me , and I was a challenge , and I was a UNK , and I was a UNK , and I was a UNK .
I was trying to use software to be able to learn about the parents , to be the people that we would like to be a member of the country .
And I wanted to take a letter to a letter called " The UNK , " and I wanted to see a UNK in Los Angeles , and it was just a little bit of a UNK , and it was just a little bit of a UNK , and it was just going to take them , and it was going to take them , and it was going to take them , and it was going to take them , and it was going to take them , and it was going to take them , and it was going to take them , and it was going to take them , and it was going to take them to do that , and it was going to take us to do that , and it was going to take them to do that , and it was going to take us to do that , and it was going to take them to do that , and it was going to take us to do that , and it was going to take us to do that , and it was going to take them to the
And I wanted to know that I was going to try to make a difference between what was going on in my mind .
And the idea of war and weapons have been able to make a lot of the environment and the environment and the environment , and I think it 's going to be the only way that I put on a museum on the UNK of the museum .
And I 'd like to point out a little bit of a simple arm that I wanted to take a little bit of a little bit of a UNK , and I wanted to look at the architecture of the wall , and I was going to show you that in the middle of the city , and I was going to show you that in the middle of the city , and I was asked by the people that I was going to meet people in the city of the city , and I was asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people that were asked by the people who were willing to
But when you do that , you might be able to meet them in jail .
But I had to do that I had to do what I was going to do .
And that 's what I do : you know what ?
Thank you .
Hi , my name is UNK UNK , and I was a surgery .
I was 10 years .
Now , in this room , I felt that there was a man who was never going to die because I didn 't have to see the trees .
And I brought a different piece of UNK .
This is TED , so I think I think we need to move forward to the first time , so I think it 's going to be pretty lucky now .
Now , if some of the women that I found out , you know , I didn 't know , but I was going to know what was going on .
I also want to tell you about what I can do to see the difference between 10 meters in my mind .
It 's not everyone 's ever going to be able to do that .
It 's not really bad news about shoes , but I can 't walk them .
The worst news is that I 'm going to put this in a picture , because this time , you know , when I was a kid , I didn 't want to do that .
It can be done .
So , why do I do that ?
It was amazing .
And it 's not just like that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The images are powerful , but the same thing is true .
I was just going to change myself in six seconds .
And so , in this picture , I was really not going to die in this picture .
And when I was a photographer , I was quite proud of the man , and I was really proud of this guy .
And the reason is , it 's not that we have to do that in a different way , and I think it 's not about us -- it 's not about us -- it 's not about us , but it 's also about the surface of the surface , and it 's also about changing our lives .
And so today , to me , it 's not just about going to be true .
I was here today because I was a surgery .
I was a friend of mine because I was a beautiful man , and we called it " UNK . "
And I asked to answer that question I was going to ask my questions .
The first question is , how do you do that ?
I was always saying , " I was discovered , but that 's not true .
The reason why I became interested because I was able to have a UNK genome , and I was responsible for you , and I was going to be able to make sure about it .
Now , in the last few months , we 've got a lot of people in the past , but the number of people that we have in the past , and the number of people that we 've been able to feed , and the body and the body , the body , the body , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK of the body .
And that 's my legacy , and that 's what I 've been working on .
I know some of you may be wondering about this , and you might be able to figure out something like this , like , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK .
First , I 'm going to show you a little bit about what it 's about to do with art .
But unfortunately , I had to tell you , when I was in New York City in New York City in New York City in New York City in New York City , there was about 16 percent , and there were only about 40 percent of the population , and there were no people , and there was no number of people , and there was no people , there was no number of people , but there was no people .
And the next question was , " How am I here ? "
And my first answer was , " I don 't know , because they didn 't make me do that . "
But the second answer was , I wanted to ask questions about the question : why ? "
You know ? You can choose anything .
You can make a difference between the United States or the next generation of the Internet , or the next generation of the Internet , or the next generation , because you 're the first one , because you 're the first one .
And if not , I mean , I would say , " No , UNK , I think I 'd say , " I said , " What 's my boss ? "
Because I can 't decide anything you can do to make a difference , or a UNK , or a UNK , or a UNK .
And so , you know , when you get to the end of the day , you 're going to say , you know , you 're going to win a little bit of this .
You can 't be able to make sure that it 's not just about your hand , but it 's pretty good , but it 's not an easy industry .
I 'm going to show you a couple of years ago , and I think , in the early years , I think , for example , is that it 's not just about a UNK heart , and it 's probably going to be alive .
So if the movie was there , and it was about light -- like , " UNK , " and I wanted to end up on this slide , and I wanted to end up with a couple of them , and I 'd like to end up on a couple of this arm , and then it 's going to be about four minutes , and then you can see that , and then back again , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And it looks like this .
And I hope that 's not surprising .
I didn 't know how to do it .
And in fact , when you get a simple job , you can 't do a lot of work , and you can say , you know , if you want to say , you want to be a leader of the United States , but you 'd say , you know , when you say , " You know , when you talk to yourself , you know , when you talk to yourself , you know , when you talk to yourself , you know , when you talk to yourself , you know , you know , when you talk to yourself , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And the next question was , " How would they take pictures ? "
Yes , they will be able to do all the pictures , but it 's only a small part of the work .
This is my first prototype picture , which is my first time when I was there .
I know it 's a little bit better , but I was young .
This is the picture that I was working on for a couple of years ago .
And this is a picture of the day .
And I was going to talk to me about this .
This is a picture of my own country , a few years ago , a couple of days ago .
This is my picture from the UNK and the UNK .
And here I am .
And I hope that you understand that this is not my own picture .
And the idea from a group of people who worked with a group of people , and the engineers , the engineers , the engineer , the engineer , the engineer , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK ,
And the next question is , " How can you get free ? "
I really learned that most of us have never seen a lot of people , but the things that were really bad about me was , but the only thing that I didn 't want to talk about is the fact that we didn 't want to talk about it .
I spent a lot of time with a company in London , and I spent a lot of money on the street , and they gave me a bunch of them .
When I was a teenager , I was going to love a UNK , and I got a UNK , and I said , " You know , I just stopped saying , " You know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know
And I got this because I was not part of my face , but some of them did not have a price for them .
I live in New York City , in the last 18 years , and in the last 18 years , 60 years , and 80 percent of the people who were killed by the people and the most young people in New York City .
And in the New York Times , young people , young people , young men and children , they said , " No , no , no , no . "
And I said , " How am I going to stop ? What are I going to do ? "
And I was working on this conference , and I found that there were about 35 million children in the United States , and it was about 75 percent , and it was about 75 percent .
And so the last question is , " What 's the difference ? "
And I guess the answer is , " If you get a little bit of a little bit , you 're going to be really happy , you 're going to be really happy , you 're going to be really happy . "
And when we go , we 're going to give up a case like this .
And we said , " You know , you can see where the journey has done , and it 's about , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
But it 's not that , but it 's not just about half of us , and I 'm not going to say that , I 'm not going to say , " I don 't care . "
Because I had to worry about what I was going to do to see what I was going to do .
And if you think about it , if I think , if my legs are much more likely , how would I be happier ?
You know , when you go to see the camera , you know , because they have the big legs , and the most beautiful and the most powerful , and they may be the most vulnerable woman in the world .
And so , when I talk about this talk , it 's really hard to find a balance , because , if I was standing here , I said , " You know , I 'm going to do a lot of what 's going on , and I think , " You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you don 't , you know , you know , if you don 't , you know , you know , if you don 't , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you don 't , you know , you know , if you don 't , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you don 't , you know , you know , you know , if you don 't , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you don 't , you know ,
But the most difficult thing is that it 's about social and social information that I think is the most powerful and the most powerful people in the world .
But when I was really happy to this , I was asked , not so much , I was working on 10 or 30 years ago , but I was not going to talk about 10 or 30 years ago , but I was never going to talk about the first thing that I was going to do when I was going to get to know how I was going to get to know what I was going to do when I was going to learn to be a work that I was going to be able to get to know what I was going to do , and I was going to do a first job of what I was going to do , and I was going to learn a little bit about what was happening in the first time that I was going to be able to get to know what I was going to do , and I was going to learn a little bit about what was happening in the first time that I was going to be able to get to know what I was going to do , and I was going to
And if this talk to you about this talk , I hope that we can all be able to enjoy the future of the image of the image of the image that we can hear , and we can understand that it 's more powerful than we understand it .
Thank you .
I just want to do a couple of things .
Don 't say I was a normal person .
I 'd like to give you a couple of my two brothers .
The year was 25 years old .
He didn 't talk about it , but it would be very popular , and it was a pretty good talk , and it was a very good talk to talk about him .
UNK knows what it 's about .
He 's no longer homeless .
He doesn 't care . He doesn 't care what it 's about .
He didn 't believe that religion , he said , " He 's never going to say that .
And when he was asked , I was asked by the song of the song , and I was asked by the song of the song , and I was asked by the words that I asked , and I was asked , " How do I know about ourselves ? " and I said , " Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
UNK has been 16 years old , and it was hard .
He 's got a different memory .
But it 's about the memory .
And he didn 't remember my chocolate , but I remember my wife 's book , and he said , " The first time of my book , " the first of the books that I wanted to talk to you about is the first time that I was talking about the first time of the city of the city of the city of the city of my mother and the UNK of my hand .
Sounds amazing ?
But a lot of people don 't think that .
And in fact , because their minds are not happy to society , and they 're very popular , and they 're very popular .
But I think that 's what I mean by the people that we believe that they 're not so smart , and they 're not quite sure , and they 're not just going to be able to tell them about , but it 's a very different kind of fact , but it 's a very different kind of fact , but it 's a very different kind of fact , but it 's a very different kind of thing .
Some of you may not be able to understand that it 's a symbol of the language , which is the brain activity of complexity , and there 's a lot of social effects in the environment .
And each one of these cases is unique , and so what 's happening here is something different .
In the world , every 20 minutes , there 's a new kind of disease , and it 's the fastest disease in the global economy , but we don 't know , but it 's not clear that it 's not clear that it 's more likely to treat it .
I remember the first time that we didn 't know , and I didn 't remember that when I was a kid .
When I was about three years old , my brother was born , and I had a new family .
And when I realized , I realized that people were never quite different from each other .
He 's very small .
And he didn 't want to just like that , because he was really interested in the same way that I was not interested in .
And the reason he was working on his own world , he was working with his own , and he was trying to figure out what was going on inside the body , and I was going to take a look at the robot , and I was going to take care of them , and I was going to eat all of them , and I was going to eat all of them in the same way that he was going to eat a car that was really going to be able to eat all the way around the house , and the robot was going to eat it .
And when he died , he was much more unique than the rest of them .
And by the time , the UNK and the UNK and the other hand , and the other thing that happened to him was that he didn 't really want to see the people that he was never heard of .
It 's so simple .
I didn 't know who was going to have a hard time , and I was going to ask them to them .
But I was going to think that I was going to think about them that I was taught by a man who taught me about a man and a man who was going to be able to make me feel that way , " I don 't want to be able to do that , " and I can 't imagine , " I don 't want to be able to do that , " and I would never like to say , " I can 't really want to say , " I can 't imagine " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know
And so often , you know , the good news about the success of the success of the people that we have about , you know , a lot of the things that we have about , you know , it 's not just about the wrong people that are coming out of this kind of thing that 's wrong with us .
I mean , it 's a different kind of difference .
And I just want to say , you know , when you 're told , you 're not going to be a normal one .
You can be quite old .
I mean , it 's not just about fireflies that we have , and it 's all about the individuals that we have , and it 's all about , you know , when you 're all about , you know , " You know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you
Also , progress and changes are going to change that we want to interact with others .
Don 't say me .
Thank you .
Now , Einstein wrote a picture of UNK on the UNK of the UNK , and it was about 10 percent of the light that we did .
But today , a hundred years later , we can quickly reduce a million times , and it 's not just about 10 percent , or more than 100 million , and it 's been about billions of thousands of people around the world .
Now , I 'm going to show you a new picture of this technology , which is a kind of a technology that 's going to be able to move into light .
So with this technology , we can create a camera camera , and see if you can see the camera , or you can see the camera on the camera , and you can see the camera on the camera , and we 're going to have a chance of thinking about what we think about the camera .
Now , if I use a laser pen , and it 's about three seconds a second , and it 's about a few seconds -- and a couple of seconds -- and it 's about a few seconds -- and it 's a camera that 's kind of -- you know , like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know , like , you know ,
Now , if you put this in this , you know , where are these lights ?
What 's going on here ?
Now , the whole thing -- so ...
Now , you know , the whole thing is that , in a way , it 's actually -- it 's a light of light -- but now I 'm going to put this in a couple of thousand times , and see if you see the camera .
But it 's not just that you can invest in .
Now , there 's a lot of things that happen , so let me give you an example .
Now , when the light comes from , you know , it 's our product , and it 's our UNK and it 's got open up in the middle of the room .
Some of the light comes out , so you 're starting to see these holes , so you 're starting to see these waves .
A lot of light comes out of a bottle , and it 's about four and a half weeks ago .
And you can see , there 's a UNK , and it 's there .
And , by the way , it comes out to the table , and it 's because in the middle of the top , you can see in the middle of the room , and you can see , in the middle of the room , you see a couple of days later , when you see a couple of them , you can see that there 's a couple of days later , you can see a couple of minutes later , when you see a couple of them , you can see that there 's a couple of days later , you can see a couple of minutes later , when you see a couple of them , you can see that there 's a couple of days later , you can see a couple of minutes later , when you see a couple of them , you can see that there 's a couple of days later , you can see a couple of minutes later , when you see a couple of them , you can see that there 's a couple of days later , you can see a couple of minutes later , you
Now , if you take a look at the same process , you know , a lot of progress , you know , a lot of progress , you know , is it going to see how long it 's going to see how long it 's going to see the process ?
One day , one week , a year .
Now , of course , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
But where are they going to do about this ?
You can see it on the table , on the table , on the screen , on the screen and the wall .
And this is what it 's about on the water .
And I think , that 's the kind of thing that we have , of course , of the way that we think about , like , again , a second , but when we see , you see the structure of the body .
But if you look at this screen , you 're going to notice , when you 're looking at the surface , it 's about getting away , and it doesn 't really matter .
Why ? Because the UNK , the UNK of the body , and it turns out to be a couple of thousand times a couple of years ago .
And so , in the future , when it comes into the future , when you 're looking at the camera , you can go to the market , and it can 't be possible if you can 't do it in a way that you can 't really be able to do if it 's not possible for you to do that , you know , you can 't do it in a way that you can 't really be able to do if it 's possible for you to do that , you can 't do it in a way that you can 't really be able to do if you 're going to be able to do that , whether you 're not going to be able to do that , and if you can 't do that , you can 't do it in a way that you can 't really be able to do if you didn 't have to do that , you know , it didn 't work if you could , you know , it didn 't have to be able to experience if you didn 't have to be able to
So , where are I going to do this in my business school in MIT ?
Now , as a result , you know , if you want a few light , and you have a little light , but we need to take a lot of light , so you can 't see anything like this .
And so what we do is we put them into a lot of light , and we take a lot of time , every time , every time , and we 're going to take a picture , and we 're going to do a picture of the number of people , and that 's what it 's about , and that 's what it 's all about .
And so what we 've done is that we 've got all sorts of data about data , and it 's really interesting .
Now , the audience can fly .
And some other heroes , like a man who wants to look at a future : he 's looking at what he 's looking for .
And this is where we can take some light up .
And so these lights are coming from the room , some people go back to the door , and go into the camera , and then we can use these lights .
This is not a picture . We really did .
On the left , you see our UNK are like a camera .
And in the wall , there 's a man in the wall , and we 're going to do a little bit of it .
And so , in our theory , it 's being used by nature , and it 's suffering from nature , and they create this vision .
And we 're going to be able to take these slides , and we 're going to take this wall , and we 're going to move away from the audience , and we 're going to go to the audience , and we 're going to end up a couple of light , and it 's going to be able to go into the camera , and , you know , it 's going to take a look , and it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know , it turns out , you know ,
And because we have a chance of going to be able to figure out how fast we are today , and we have some of them , and it 's kind of going to be able to do something about it .
And it 's good for long time , and it can be able to light up the world .
And so , we didn 't know about the opportunity to get away from the same , but we didn 't know what was going to be the way that we didn 't know .
And by the way , we can record the first picture , and you can see it in the screen , but a lot of them , and it 's a lot of us , and it 's a lot of us , and , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
How can we see that ?
That 's our model .
Now , in the same way that we can take these together , and we can put it in a way , and we can look at this , and we can look at it , because we can look at the environment , and we can build the body , or see if we can build the body , or see what we can do with the body , and we can look at the heart of the body , and see if we can look at the body and see the body of the body , and see what we can do with the body of the body .
But of course , of course , of course , for example , in all kinds of organizations and blood vessels , and so we would have to look at science as a way to look at science as a way of thinking about as a kind of a solution that was a way of thinking about a way to kind of a solution to a kind of a solution that was going to be a kind of a solution that was going to be a kind of a solution that was going to be a kind of a solution that was going to be a kind of a solution to a kind of a solution that was going to be a way of going into a way that was going to be a kind of a solution that was going to be a kind of a solution that was going to be a kind of a solution for a kind of a solution that was going to be a way of going into a way that was going to be a kind of a solution that was going to be a kind of a solution that was going to
Now , as a scientist , a scientist , a scientist , as a scientist , and I realized that we would have a huge amount of music , and it was a kind of a new kind of model , and , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , when you look at this , you know , this is a kind of a UNK , and it 's kind of a bit of a kind of a UNK , and you know , when you look at it , you know , when you look at it , you know , when you look at it , you know , when you look at it , you know , when you look at it , you know , when you look at it , you know , when you look at it , you know , when you look at the
But the interesting thing is happening .
And when you see these particles , they 're just leaving us .
But this is what it 's about to do .
What happened ?
And the results were , because we were able to light up these things , and we had a lot of weird phenomena , and the people would see a lot of these images .
And so what 's happening here is , in fact , sometimes when you get into a camera , so you can take a lot of a lot of time , and we can take a look at the music and space and space , and we can take that kind of button and space into space .
So if we look at the idea of view , or the fact that it 's going to be about , and we have to do that , and we 're going to have a kind of social impact , and we 're going to have a lot of information , and we 're going to tell us that we should never be able to do that , and we will never be able to do that , and when we 're going to do that , you know , we should never be able to do that in a way that we should , but start to live in the same way that we need to be able to do that , and we 're going to start to look at the other parts of the human technology that we need to be able to do , and we 're going to start to look at the same kind of thing that we should do , and we 're going to start to look at the other parts of the human technology that we need to be able to do , and we 're going to start to look
It 's a lot of time . Thank you .
This is where I live , Kenya , Nigeria in the U.K.
And on my left , my father of my father was on the other side of the Library of England .
In the South Bronx , it 's not all around the island , but it means like a spider that 's being used as a symbol of the future , and it 's going to be able to move around in the park .
So , like the monkeys , like the lions , they will look at them , so they do that .
They killed our house .
And so this is just a night of a night , and I found that when I was a child , I found out that I was dead , because this was my office .
The people that we have taught us that we have about our animals and our animals and our lives , and that 's why we 're so happy about what we 're looking at .
And so I moved to a UNK party .
The Greeks are people who protect our family and our families , but they 're different from this problem .
So they decided to kill those lions .
This is one of them that they spent most of the lions in Iraq .
And I think that 's why there are so many other schools that are coming out of the kitchen .
In our own family , a couple of years , a whole bunch of people were surrounded by the parents , and the parents were hungry , and the same thing happened to me .
So I had to find a solution to a solution .
And I think the first way that I want to do is to use fire , because I know that the lions are really scared .
But I realized that this didn 't really work very well , but also helped us see our instruments .
But I didn 't give up , I would never wait .
And then the second way : it 's about UNK .
And I wanted to argue that I wanted to argue that I was going to do this in my pocket .
But lions are smart .
And the first day they saw it , and I went back to him , and I went back to that , and they came back , and they would say , well , it 's never going to be there , and it 's never going to be there .
So they came back , and killed animals .
And one night , I took my laptop on a plane , and the lions didn 't .
And I started to realize that the lions would feel worse .
So , I kind of got an idea .
Because when I was a kid , I could take a little kid on my own house , and I didn 't even have to take a while of my mother , even though I was going to die , and I learned a lot of what I learned about a lot of electronics .
And so I found a UNK cell phone and a UNK machine that was used by a UNK bike arm that was used to control the car of the car , so it was going to be a little bit of a symphony of surgery .
And I found a kind of a challenge that was able to control the fire .
UNK comes from a UNK device .
Everything was ready .
And as you can see , the sun will be able to put it into the grid , and it 's going to be about electricity , and it 's going to show you what it 's like to call it to " UNK . "
And the idea of this idea of light is going to turn out .
And you can see , it 's kind of a lamp , because the lions are coming from there .
And when I was a kid , I was looking at the same .
And this light was going to be a UNK of the orchestra , and it 's going to be used for me to be able to move away , but in fact , in fact , when I was in surgery , I was doing a pretty good job of myself .
Thank you .
I took this device on two years ago , and I was never going to have a lion of the people that we didn 't .
And my neighbor was all about this approach .
One of them was that old lady .
And she 's a child 's suffering with his family , and she 's not going to be able to take a picture of this in the house .
I love compassion .
And so I put those lights on , and you can see , these are UNK .
And so today , I have spent a house in our neighborhood , and it 's been very useful for us .
Now , my approach is being used by Kenya , and it 's used as a UNK animal that 's used as much as a kind of UNK and the size of the United States , as a result of the size of the size of the human species .
And I was fortunate to because of this , and it was great to teach school , and it was one of the most beautiful schools in Europe , and I was so excited .
And my new school has come out , and help me to improve more funding .
I even asked my friends , helping them , to help their communities in the house , and I would teach them how to do it .
A year ago , I was a UNK , and I was very excited about my father 's hand , and I was really looking at the plane , and I was going to have a plane , and I was going to have a couple of them , and I was going to have a couple of them , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days ago , and I was going to meet a couple of days , and I was going to meet a couple of
And today , I did .
I got a chance to TED , and this is my first time .
And so my dream dream was : when I grew up , became a UNK engineer .
I was going to go to jail , but now it 's time for me to save my father 's friends and our teachers .
Thank you very much . I mean , you know , it 's about -- thank you very much .
You 're not going to believe , you know , listen to your story .
So you 've got this prize . UNK UNK : Yes .
You 're not going to work with a laptop ?
What 's next ?
So my next next project is , I want to do a laptop , and I want to do a UNK .
RB : I know that the power of electricity is there , but I just wanted to do my own one .
So , you know , when you do that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , because it hurts .
It 's a UNK . UNK UNK , you have different people .
We 're going to be able to take a step into each of these , and it 's friends .
Thank you . Thank you .
I live in Los Angeles .
And this is the river of Los Angeles : UNK UNK , UNK UNK .
And so what 's happening here is , they sit around the city of the city , and they spent a lot of time thinking about it , and so they brought it into the South Pole , and it 's going to explain this to the South Pole .
This is the South Pole .
UNK , UNK . UNK land .
And there are about two million Americans , and I live in a food zone , and it 's going to be really fast , and it 's going to be really fast in terms of the way that it 's about to move around , and it 's not going to be able to move around and fly around , and you can 't move around , and you can 't move around , and you can 't move around , and you can 't move around , and you can 't move around .
The interesting thing is that it 's going to reduce the number of people who killed death .
In the Gulf of Los Angeles , people have died of disease .
For example , my streets of the streets of the streets of my streets were about 10 times more than 10 miles a day , and maybe more than 10 times .
And I was fascinated by this .
And at the same time , when I was thinking about food , you know , when you get into a healthy food , you see the amount of food in your communities , when you see the food system , where do you feel about your communities ?
I see a car that 's going to sell like a car machine .
I see the optimism bias , the same kind of thing .
I don 't think so .
And I think the answer is there .
food is a problem . food is a solution .
And then I was going to go out to buy a 40 minutes later to go to the next 10 minutes .
And so what I did was , I was in my house , and I was in my house .
It 's about us that we call it UNK .
The 15 feet is 10 feet wide .
The green line is all about the government .
But it 's about people who need to protect it .
And so I thought , " That 's great . That 's my responsibility , and I must take it , so I think what 's going on ? "
This is why I wanted to protect it .
And so my team and I said , " UNK , " and we were starting to see ourselves in a different kind of food model , a tree and a whole whole whole whole whole whole lot .
We are a free organization , and the people from different cultures , and people , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , we were a lot of people , and we did everything in a different way .
It 's pretty beautiful .
But you know , you know , you get a lot of people .
And the government was responsible , and I gave a talk to me about what I needed to do when I needed to go to my garden and tell you about the police .
And I thought , " What 's wrong ?
Now , it 's not about food in the size of food .
And I thought , " Well , you know what ? "
Because it didn 't happen .
And so what 's happened is , by the way , by the way , is written by a man who wrote a book about his story , and it 's going to talk to a UNK , and it 's going to give a book , and it 's going to give up a book , and it 's about to be able to figure out how to make it , and it 's got to be done by the people , and it 's got to be done by the people , and it 's got to be done by the people , and it 's been given us to do that .
We use our instruments with our hands .
And by the way , I said , you know , there 's a lot of people who have a lot of joy and love about what we do .
I mean , of course , how can we do that ?
The amount of things that we have on the street has been around for the United States in America .
It has about 26 degrees of space on it .
That 's about 20 minutes a couple of them .
It 's got a lot of space , and it 's about 35 million of them .
How did they do that ?
One tree is able to get about 10 , and it 's even more .
The green line is that you take about 75 dollars .
And that 's my message , and I tell people about the food .
You know , it 's about the food that you have in your own food .
You see , in Los Angeles , I had a choice .
I grew up there , and I was there with my son .
And I became a UNK of the universe , and I wanted to be part of my own reality , and I wanted to create my own reality .
I see that , I 'm an artist .
And I did that for example , that I was able to build my own art and build myself myself .
It 's like UNK artists , and they 're beautiful and green and green , green and green .
I took a garden and I found a picture , and the plants and the trees were on the street .
You might be able to do that , if you want to do that , if you want it to be done .
And you can 't imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how you can imagine how it 's going to affect the human brain .
So what 's going to happen ?
I was so excited that I had become a tool about education , and became a tool for my community .
To change the communities , you have to change the city .
We 're soil .
You would expect them to be able to figure out how to make a difference .
The difference is the most powerful , the most powerful way to be healthy and challenging , and especially in the city of the city .
And you can also be able to take a UNK .
And I remember once , a girl and a half a half hours of UNK on a Friday night , when I was there , when I was asked , when I was seeing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you see , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And so what they found was amazing , and I told them , you didn 't like to eat food .
This is why it 's not in the street .
And when I saw the people that I was on the door , I thought , " Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " What 's wrong with you ? "
And I said , " Of course , I 'm not afraid of people .
And that 's why it 's in the street .
And that 's what I wanted to do .
I want people to take it , but also , I want people to be healthy . "
And once again , when I was a child in Los Angeles , I was a UNK .
And so these small little things that helped me .
It 's very cool , and they share a lot of stories about what they do , and when they make them influence , they can change their own lives , and see if they can change their own lives , and they can change their behavior , and it 's very cool , and it 's a very cool thing to do with them , and it 's really cool to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really cool for them to do that , and it 's really
The green line is also about 200 pounds a few times .
We 've got about 50 percent of the population that we have , and they 're all volunteers .
And if kids are UNK , kids will eat .
If they are so far away , they 're going to eat UNK .
But it 's not all about kids , and if they didn 't , if they were not going to eat food or body , they would just be a little bit of the food that they were just looking at .
I saw these young people , and they wanted to work , but they were really happy to see , and I saw a different kind of music , and I saw a lot of different people about who they thought , and that was not going to happen to them .
And when I started to do a research , I found a chance that we could train these kids , and put them in a way that was going to work in the communities .
Now , when we do that , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
It 's about 10 to 10 pages a day .
But if we didn 't change the city , we would never do that .
And I wanted to do that . This is what I wanted to do .
And I want to share with a whole street room where people will share their food .
I wanted to put them in a way that I wanted to be a healthy .
Don 't get me wrong .
I didn 't want to be free , because it 's not sustainable .
And what you need to do is , you know , UNK -- you have to wait for it .
What I 'm going to tell you about is people who are starting to work , to make children 's lives , to make sure that their own food , to be able to learn to their own food , is to provide farmers 's market .
And so I wanted to do something about thinking about this plan .
And I want to be free of the environment of the environment , the civil war , the civil war .
We need to write the definition of suffering .
If you 're not a park , you 're not a UNK .
How are you going to take a car ? How is it ?
You put it into a weapon of choice .
And basically , if you think about it , if you want to , if you want to , if you 're going to talk about , if you 're going to talk to me about a few minutes , you know , when you talk to me , you know , if you 're sitting on the chair , you 're going to talk to me about a few minutes .
And if I think , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can take a little bit of a little bit of a UNK .
So , thank you .
Thank you .
I was a photographer , and I was a photographer , and I was born to New York City .
We UNK and die of death .
We were being black , and we didn 't have a lot to see if we didn 't have a window on a day , so you didn 't have a window , you know , you know , you know , you know , when you don 't have a street , you have a window of light .
And so we can take a picture of this , and put it into a UNK of color , and we 're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that , but we 're actually going to be about the art of the art of the art of the art of the art , but it 's a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
I saw a lot of people on the planet , and I was looking at the whole thing that I saw in my home .
But a month later , I was asked by a group of people that I was going to do a group of volunteers , and in a few days , in a few days , in a way that was going to save a lot of activity in the city .
And I share a lot of other people , and I can 't care about them -- so I decided to join them in a way that I was going to be able to save a couple of them , and I decided that I was going to be able to save a difference .
I was five years old , and I was going to go about a couple of weeks .
It was a little bit of a small village that was about five people , and it was the right place for the first time .
You know , when the number of people died of UNK died at the age of UNK , you get about two miles of land on the ground .
You can imagine , it 's a UNK .
We developed a lot of instruments and water .
We can help schools and all the houses of the house and the environment , the new and the new .
We have a huge amount of UNK , and UNK fish that were being part of space , and UNK fish .
And we were able to turn ourselves into ourselves , but we did a lot of it .
And a couple of weeks , all the volunteers and the local communities , came to some sort of stuff .
And they were able to figure out pictures , like , UNK and UNK .
Everybody wants to move from each other 's response to this .
And so they put these pictures together and they put them in a way to take care of them .
Now , I realized that there was a huge amount of people that I found out of them .
And when they come back at the same time , they want to know , and it 's going to know that it 's going to be because there are four million people on the planet , and the people themselves , and all the other things that they do .
I was on the first day in the first week , and I found myself in a way that was going to be a UNK center .
You know , you help , you know , a huge amount of land in the environment .
You know , in a way , the amount of information is about the people who are hungry .
People put people into the picture of the city , and when I was really lucky enough , I was starting to ask , if I was going to go to the store and see the pictures .
And the people who were there , and I was really grateful , and I was listening to people that said , " Don 't be creative , I just did that , and I really did that . "
And when I look at these pictures , some of those years , and some of the history of people that I don 't know , and I can help them , and maybe I can help them to take these images and be able to help them feel like that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And so , when I was a kid , I was a UNK , and I didn 't have a UNK friend , and I didn 't have a lot of talk to them , and I know that they were willing to help us , and I know that we should do this .
And so we started to move around .
This is a picture of the test process .
And it 's not rocket that it 's not really bad for us because it 's not so good that it 's about to take a picture of the size of the water , and we had to take care of them to do that , and you know , you know , you know , you can 't really care about it , you know , you know , you know , you can 't really care about it , you know , you know , you can 't really care about it , you know , you know , you can 't really care about it , but you can 't really care about it , you know , you know , you can 't really care about it , you know , you know , you can 't really care about it , but you can 't really care about it , you know , you know , you know , you can 't really care about it , you know , you know , you can 't really care about it , you know , you know , you can 't really care about it ,
Otherwise , a child 's face doesn 't look like she 's face of her face -- there 's a lot of things about it .
And then , by the time , we had to take a picture of a lot , and we had to take a lot of engineers to help these images , and I wanted to help the Internet and the Internet and the Internet , and it was about 50 percent of the Internet , and it was about 50 years from the Internet , and it was about 80 years from the Internet , and it was about 80 percent of the people that were being asked to help people to save their own countries .
You know , two weeks , I got about 50 volunteers , and they showed people who were willing to die .
At the end of the day , we had a lot of support , and there was a lot of land that we had , and there was a lot of land in the city of New York City .
You know , every week , we have a UNK device , and people come to see their pictures in this way .
And sometimes , a few years from the people , when they met a few years ago , they could take pictures of them , and then they could take pictures of them , and then they would be able to put them on a table , and they would be able to move from the other end of the planet , and they would be able to put them into the other end of the planet , which was going to happen to the next to the other end of the planet , and the picture was going to be transformed by the end of the planet .
But , of course , they had to take these pictures , and it was different , you know , of course , it was hard to lose the process .
Maybe you can make a little bit better , maybe it 's going to be about a few weeks .
It 's even a few months .
The beautiful and secret needs to take place , or a little bit of a little bit of a UNK , put them on top of the surface , and put them into a different place where there were no water left .
The whole process was very expensive .
And so these UNK , UNK of the ocean , has been found by bacteria , and yet in the middle of Africa , and all of them would be able to walk into this space , and all of them would be able to move into this experience , and all of them would be part of this project that was part of this project that was going to be part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this project that was part of this
And if these images are not going to be able to figure out , we can 't open up , you know , but you have to be able to move forward , and you have to do that , and you have to do that , and you know , you know , you know , it 's got to be done , and it 's going to have to do it .
Our strategy is very popular in our hands .
I mean , there 's also a lady that 's been told us .
These pictures are very easy and smart .
And when my team was diagnosed , it was like being in the past .
You can 't have any child , you can 't .
And that gave us a picture of these pictures , and it was sort of like these pictures .
She 's starting to take a picture of her mother , until she realized that she 's not going to be able to do a lot of UNK .
All right , let 's take a picture of them .
No , for example , her face of the face of the face of the face of her , her mother , she had changed , so we could put all the parts of the picture , and then we put this picture .
And when I was a picture of the picture , she was told us about a picture of the picture .
And so these pictures are made of the same thing that happened when she died , in the region of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city , and the rest of the house was actually quite close to him .
As a child , he was responsible for the environment to protect the human mind .
And when the police was coming , he didn 't have to UNK .
She 's about two kids , and it 's not very small , but in two different schools .
One of the kids that was a child 's school was burned .
And she spent the entire week , and the father 's father , when they died .
And I gave her a picture of her , and she was about 14 years old .
For her , for her , for example , in his case , in his case of his wife and his wife , he was just going to give a difference to his wife , and it was about three years ago , and he 's got a third of his life , and he said , " You know , you know , you know , when he 's about to change , you know , when he 's about to change , he 's about to change , or you know , or in his life , you know , you know , you know , you know , when he 's about to change , you know , you know , when he 's about to change , you know , you know , when he 's about to change , you know , you know , when he 's about to change , you know , you know , when he 's about to change , you know , you know , when he 's about to change , you know , you know , when he 's about to change , he 's got a
In six months after six months , he was asked by a man who was going to have a child , a couple of years ago , and a couple of years ago , we had a lot of us -- a lot of them -- a lot of them -- a lot of them -- a lot of them -- a lot of them -- a lot of -- -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- a lot of them -- a lot of -- -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- and a lot of them -- a lot of -- -- and a lot of them --
Most of them came back to the heart , and it was very important .
All the world from 50 years to help us find the number of hundreds of people in the city of 10 families , and it 's all about the whole part of the body , and it 's all about the whole part of the body , and it 's all about the whole part of the body , and it 's being built up .
In this time , we didn 't have to have a device or a UNK , so it was used by print water .
And so we looked at it .
The picture is a friend of Canada and asking us some people and some other people , and the rest of them , in a way , a sense of people .
They help us about our own journey , and our past , and our past , our very first time , and when we were asked , when we were asked , when we started to look at things that we wanted to , when we started to look at things that we wanted to know , but we wanted to look at things that we wanted to look forward to .
And so this is part of this project , because it 's a little bit of a UNK camera that 's going to be involved in the past .
And when you look at this picture , it 's going to take a huge difference , and it 's going to be different from your life .
And I think that 's the case that we brought out with this idea .
For a couple of years , it 's got a lot of relationships , and connection about some of them , like the civil society , not only with the human body , not just about the skin of the mouse , but it 's not just about the body of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it 's not just about the skin of the mouse , and it
I want to give you a little bit of a book about a street , and I put a letter on the street , and from the end , it 's about six months later that I was coming home from the same day .
" When I was walking around , I didn 't want to see the stories of the people in this picture .
One of them is a picture of a month , and a young girl , and she 's got a little girl , because I have a UNK , and my grandmother , my mother , my mother , my mother , my mother , my wife , my UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK of the house , and the
Now , it 's about two percent of the world , and it 's going to be something that we have a fundamental needs to demand , isn 't it ? "
Thank you .
And today , I want to talk to you about a very bad question : the answer to this question .
I 'm going to tell you about family 's secret , and I 'm going to ask questions about this question : " Why is it going to hurt her ? "
How do you have people ? How do you want to live together ? "
I 'm not a UNK doctor , a community of family or family .
I was just one of the women who wanted to talk to you .
When I was about 12 , I was just going to go to school .
And I moved to New York , starting to New York , and I started working with the first of the work of the first job called " UNK . "
I first got a house in my own house , and I got a very strong secret to my own house .
And the secret part of this is that I think that I think that the man that I think that I think about the human body , which is what I think is about , in a way , a lot of time -- a lot of times , a lot of times , a lot of times , a lot of times , a lot of times , a lot of times , a lot of times .
And this was my favorite person , and when I was a musician , I was diagnosed with a lot of people who were hungry , and I remember that I was going to do a lot of times .
Now , in this case , the stories that I 'm talking about , is a UNK of love , and you have millions of years of life , and even though there 's a couple of other things that are going to die .
Maybe , it 's happening in your body .
I see that there was not just a typical house called UNK .
I was asked to give a English scientist , and I got a call from the UNK Institute in Boston .
And I decided that I was going to spend a lot of time in " UNK , " and UNK , UNK and Washington .
My wife gave me more than 20 years , and three children .
I bought a black UNK , and I took a UNK UNK .
And so I 'm going to tell you about the first thing : the family of violence , which is happening in every person , has no idea of what 's happening , information and education , education and education .
It 's everywhere .
The second thing that I want to say to you about is that most people say that there 's a lot of people who live there , and that 's going to be an amazing question .
No .
And about 25 percent of the people who were men who were men and families were born in the audience , in the family , in the family , in the same place , in the same way , to the local communities , the local communities that we would expect to , or the most of us , to see the land of violence , and that 's why it 's not that 's why it 's so valuable that 's why it 's so valuable that it 's about to be part of the reasons why it 's about to be part of the reasons why it 's about to be part of the reason that it 's about to be part of the way that it 's about to be part of the way that it 's about to be part of the way that it 's about to be part of the way that it 's about to be part of the way that it 's about to be part of the way that it 's about to be part of the way that it 's about to be part of the way that it 's
I was part of a man who was going to die in the world , but in fact , in fact , in fact , I was really quite interested in my childhood .
When I was 25 years old , I was 25 years old , and I was about eight years old in the United States , and I was 16 years old in the United States , and it was about 50 years , and it was more than 50 years from the United States , and it was about 50 years from the United States , and it was about as a child , as a child , as a child , or a husband , or a husband .
I was a very typical victim , because my family and development models were not aware of it .
I met a UNK , and I was a UNK .
And so , in New York City in New York City , he sat down , and he talked to me about it .
He told me about two things .
The first one is that he 's been working on a high school , and it 's working in a very nice street bank program .
But the first thing that I want to leave you with is what I want to show you , is that his wisdom and humor and his eyes seem to be like a farm .
His face of his face is like a UNK UNK that looks like a UNK .
And most of the most recent things that I would do , in a way , to make sure that , in this case , was a powerful one .
And when I did , he gave me a picture of his father .
And so we started to start , and he likes to talk to me about what I was , and I said , I was going to do a lot of my talk , and I gave years to help , to help me , to do a lot of my work .
He was willing to understand my family , my childhood and my dreams .
When I was a surgeon , I became a woman and a woman , and never been there .
And by the way , by the way , as a result , he did a lot of his identity , and he told me that he was going to take care of his identity , and he said , " He 's going to take place on his body , " he said , " he didn 't have to wait for a while , when he was going to do a lot of a year ago , he spent a lot of time when he was there , he spent a lot of time , he spent a lot of time , he spent a lot of time , he spent a lot of time , he spent a lot of time , he spent a lot of time , and he spent a lot of time , and he spent a couple of years of time , he spent a lot of time , and he spent a couple of years of time , he spent a lot of time , he spent a lot of time , and he spent a lot of time , and he spent a lot of time , and he spent
And that 's why it 's so used to be a good student , and the work of the street , the future , the future , is really important .
And when I was a child , I was a member of a friend of mine , and my family was going to be able to do that , and I was going to do a lot of work , and then I was going to do a lot of work , and I 'd like to do a little bit of work , and I 'd like to point to you about a little bit of a UNK or a little bit of a UNK or a UNK or a UNK .
And I didn 't know when I didn 't know when I was a member of a man who was suffering from his family .
I didn 't know , and the step was to be a victim .
You know , it 's great to say , " Well , you know , I 'm going to leave you to the next stage , but I want to leave you with you , and I 'm going to show you a UNK of your friend , and the city of the family and the people that you see are not going to see you , and the rest of your friends and the rest of the city and the people that you see are not going to see you , and the rest of your friends and the rest of the city and the people that you see are not going to see you , and the rest of your friends and the rest of the city and the people that you see are not going to see you , you know , your friends and family and different things that you can see , and the city of the family and the people that you see are not going to see you , you know , your friends and family and different things that you can see , and the city of the family and the people
And in fact , when I was a kid on a Friday night , he told me that he had a lot of peace , and he said he was going to do a lot of happiness , and I asked him to leave the city , and the rest of the city he was going to be to go to the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the
And when I really want to do that , I really want to leave you from New York to New York City , but I wanted to be a UNK , and I wanted to do something about it , so I thought , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And I thought to myself , I didn 't know what I was , but I didn 't know that I was going to be able to make a way of control the body of the body and the experience of the body and the economy of the body .
The third phase of violence is that it 's starting to take the violence of violence from the violence of violence .
And that 's what I found out of the gun .
And we moved to New Zealand -- I think , UNK should be very safe -- and he 's got three architects .
It 's a different way of going through the car .
One of the things that we 're going to do is put up on the top of the forest , and the third one is going to be in there .
And when he said that , when he said that , he was going to have to use them .
Let 's do it for themselves .
And the people that I would say to be a clear message , although he didn 't have a gun back , I was not going to be in danger of the danger .
The first time I was working on is my fifth five days .
It was a UNK , and I was sleeping at night .
And I was working on a computer , and I wanted to make a difference in my head , and I was going to have a lot of UNK , and I was going to be able to take care of them , and put them into my neck and put them on my feet , and I would never breathe , and I was going to go to the other side of the car , and from the way I was going to die from the other side of my neck , and I was going to go out of the wall , and from the way I was going to go to my neck , and I was going to go out of the wall , and from the way I was going to go to the other side of my neck , and I was going to go out of the wall , and from the way I was going to go to the other side of my neck , and I was going to go out of the wall , and I was going to come out of the way that I was going on to
Five months later , a man on a UNK , I was wearing my mother 's daughter , who gave him his daughter .
And even though these things happen , I still believe that we can go to happiness , because we like to live , because we 're so grateful .
And what he 's seeing is what he 's looking at .
He was just about the pressure , and the UNK and the UNK of my family was coming back .
And this is a mind , and he 's never going to hurt me .
And it was about two times when I was about two or three times .
And the first time I was going to go to war on a different night , and I was sitting on the street , and I was just going to take a picture of the robot , and I was going to take a picture of the robot that I was able to get into the car .
But before , a few days later , he gave a UNK car on his car , and he put it on a UNK , and he 's got a UNK of his face on my face .
When I was about two and a half years old , I was going to be two times two times .
I was told that I was one of my own old .
In fact , one of these American women in the United States has been a family of family or a UNK , and it 's about 15 million children per year , and 15 million children have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed , and 15 million people have been killed ,
So , in fact , I 'm not an example .
And I asked my question : why do I want to leave that ?
And the answer is very simple .
I didn 't know that he was on me .
And as a result of that , when I was working on my head , I put my hand on a train , and I would put them on a plane , and I was going to try to put them on my hands , and I never thought about myself on my hands , and I never thought of myself as a kind of love to myself , and I never thought of myself as a kind of a UNK .
And as a result , I was a very strong and passionate for the man of the patient , and I was one of the people that I was going to be able to take care of what was going on .
The other problem that you wanted to ask was , why didn 't you leave them ?
I didn 't have a lot , and I had a lot of opportunities .
And for me , it 's a question that people asked me to know the questions that you didn 't understand , but it was a lot of UNK that we didn 't know .
Because the last step of violence in the family has been killed .
And over 80 percent of the family 's violence has been diagnosed in the victims of the victims , and in the past , you know , he 's never forgotten .
And it was possible for a long time , and it was going to be a long way to go to war , and to give them a child , a child , a child , a child , a child , a child who was going to ask people to ask the people that they were going to have asked them to be a little bit of a man who was going to have asked them to be a little bit of a child 's mind that they were going to ask for the first time that their parents were going to be asked by the people that their parents were going to be asked by the people that their parents were going to have asked them to be a little bit of a man who was going to have asked them to be a little bit of a boy who was going to be asked by a man who was asked to be a child 's heart of the mother of his mother .
Now , can we ask , why not so ?
And so I decided that I was going to leave , and it was because the first time of violence in the last 50 percent is possible .
And I realized that if I didn 't recommend that , I would love to die and die .
And so I was UNK .
And so I asked people : UNK , my friends and family , my family and family , I would stand here , because everyone 's going to help me .
And we tend to write information to the victims of the victims of the victims , the women and the women in a new way .
" Why don 't you want to leave them ? "
Some people are actually saying , " It 's her for her , like the victims of the victims and the UNK of the audience .
But when the book was published , a lot of men and people told me about what their stories , and they wanted to know , and they started to learn -- as a happy life -- a happy life -- as a child and a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child , as a child ,
In fact , I 'm a UNK family UNK , and the UNK family UNK .
And I talked to people about seven kids , three children , three children .
I bought a black UNK , and I took a UNK UNK .
And I was never going to be able to do that , and I was never going to have a voice that was asked by my own body .
And so , that 's when you 're thinking , well , like , " Oh , well , you know , " Oh , you know , you know , " Oh , you know , " Oh , you know , " but in the whole process , in the whole process , you know , I was talking to you about it .
I can 't believe that there are some people in the audience who are suffering from each other , or more or less or less or less or less or less or less .
You can see yourself being born on your daughter , and your sister , your best friend .
And I can end up the way that the love of the pain of the spirit of suffering is that it 's hidden black .
And today , I still still UNK .
This is the way I can help people in other people , and I 'm going to show you the last time .
Let me tell you what you see today .
You know , it 's not going to be alive .
You have to be able to make a difference between your family 's violence .
We love the victims of the patient .
We need to give you a secret to your family .
You know , your kids , your colleagues , your family and family talk about this talk , which is going to happen to us .
You know , you can help to reduce the disease or be able to live , to love , to have a future , to be able to use it .
And when you think about violence , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Let 's put it together , let 's put our village and family and family and family security as a safe and peace and green .
Thank you .
When I was a child , I think my country 's best in the world , and I learned a little bit of a book that I learned to say , " UNK . "
I think so much .
And in school , we used a lot of time to learn to learn , but we did have a lot of other worlds in the world , except for the American and the United States .
And I was also surprised to see the world , and I thought I was going to live my life through this thing that was going to be changed .
When I was seven years old , I met a lesson , but I think I think my life 's going to be normal .
My family was not poor . I was asked by myself , I was never going to experience my experience .
But in the summer of the year , my mother took a letter to home , and it was about her .
And I wrote about saying , " When you read this , my five percent of my family will be left , because we have about two weeks .
Now , we 're now on the floor , and we 're all about the body , and we 're waiting to die . "
I was really surprised .
And that was my first audience that I heard of living in my country .
And after that last time , when I walked into a car station , I saw a very sad thing to me .
One of the people who were a big car on a city of a UNK car who was left with a UNK child who was going to show his mother 's face of his mother 's face .
But no one 's going to help them , because the family and his own own own .
In the early ' 90s , there was a huge trend in the early ' 90s .
Unfortunately , more than half a million people were killed by hunger , and most of them are UNK and trees and trees .
And by the way , it was getting worse , and it was going to be a bit of a picture of my childhood , and it was just going to be a little bit of my house , just as you know , when I was in China .
I was thinking about why they were light and we didn 't .
This is a picture of a revolution , and it 's about the size of the night and the size of the country .
This is a UNK , and it 's part of China and North America .
And as you can see , this river works very well , and it 's used to be able to figure out how to die in the United States .
But a lot of the people who tried it .
And sometimes I see the body water on the water .
I can 't wait for a couple of years , but I can tell the difference , but I can say that there 's only one of the most important years I 've ever mentioned , and I 've been about to live in the United States .
And I thought , I was just going to share a lot of time with my family .
But I didn 't remember that , about 14 years , we were going to have a lot of it .
In China , I became a UNK girl with a family girl .
I didn 't know , as a child , as a friend of mine , but I was quite happy to know that life didn 't seem to be very dangerous , because the parents would have been diagnosed with other people in China .
And so I was always living in fear , and I was afraid that my identity would be discovered , and I would have a conversation that I would never meet back back to my father 's life .
One day , my worst passion , and I was asked by the British police police and the police police police .
I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
I was really scared . I was happy to be angry .
And if there 's any difference , I would be diagnosed with each other .
And I thought that my mother was finished . And yet , I was trying to hide the fear of fear and worry , and answer them to their questions .
And after a while , a police said , " UNK is wrong .
She 's not a UNK . "
And then they brought up . It was a miracle .
And some of the people in China have died in China , but a lot of people have been caught by the British police , and they 're sent back .
These girls are lucky .
And even though they were caught , you know , because the big thing about this is that it 's not just about the size of the political revolution , but it turns out to be very , very recently .
But some of them are still not lucky .
And every year , the number of people that were being killed in China , they were being invited back to jail , and they were asked to , like , UNK or UNK .
And even though , I was lucky enough to get away from a friend of mine , and my wife didn 't have that kind of oxygen .
It 's a very sad thing , and that 's where people need to be able to survive , so on , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
And even though they learned it , they found it , and their whole world was going to be UNK .
And that 's why , when I was a kid , I decided to take a career in the neighborhood , and I was going to start a new life .
I was interested in the United States , and I was thinking about a challenge .
English is in the United States , so I must start to learn about three words : English .
And so , I realized that there was a huge difference between the United States and the North Bronx .
And even though we were UNK people , but we were very different , and we were six years old .
I even became a proud of myself .
How am I going to die ?
Where 's where ? Am I ?
And suddenly , I seem to call myself a country 's own country called my own country .
And even though , by the way , it 's not about the size of the country , but it 's also , but I decided that I was going to do it .
You know , ready to learn from college .
And so I started to learn about new lives , and I got a pretty amazing talk .
The government took me home , and it was a lot of my money , and I was going to take care of my family and moved into the city of the village .
They had to walk up faster , so I started to figure out how to help them .
It 's not surprising that it 's been used by the way .
And I think , in a way that 's not possible to look at the map of the United States , so it 's possible to see that there are a lot of what I 've been about to do to see China from China to China , and I 'm going to go back to China to China , and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to go back to China and I was going to
Because my family didn 't know , so I was going to help them live in China in China .
We lived on a journey with a week , a week , a couple of days later .
Again , we were sitting on a UNK , a Chinese officer .
And he was looking at a different person , and started to ask questions .
Because my family didn 't know , and I fear them .
And so , when the Chinese police came out , I was going to tell my family , and I was going to tell him about this , and I was a member of them , and I was a member of them .
He didn 't see me when I was , but lucky , he believed that .
And so , we went to the clinic , but I was going to take a look at the idea of what was going to happen to the local communities .
And even when we got this , my family was never going around .
And when I met the money of the funding and the money , my family was told , but , when they said , they were caught up .
I was one of the poorest moments of my life .
And I gave my family away from my family , and I was going to take a long time when I was there , and I was going to do a lot of people who wanted to be a UNK , and the prison would never be there .
I was going to go back to the private and the police , and I was going to take a lot of time , and hope to put them on , and I didn 't have enough money to give them a way to make a difference or whether or not .
I mean UNK .
And at the time , I heard a man , and I said , " How ? "
And I was a journalist , a UNK person who was asked .
And I took a picture from my feet , and I had no idea where it was going to be able to explain -- from my family and the same friend that I was asked by a man who was given to jail for the first time that I was asked by the people that I was asked by the people that I was given to my family .
I really want to thank that , " How would you help me ? "
" I 'm not going to help you , " he said .
" I 'm a UNK person . "
And I realized that that was the moment that I was quite interested in life .
And the beauty of the optimism , and the most important hope that I love and the most important people that I know , and the message of my life and the social social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the people that we need to take care of the people that we need to die to the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the social and the people that we need to take
And finally , in the history of the past , I was moved to California , and I talked to people about the United States , but the freedom of the future was just about the war of war .
Many people and their family share their families , and when they come to new countries , they 're just less likely , or UNK .
And so we can use international social support for education , and it 's been trained .
And we can do that in the same way that we live in the same way that we live in the communities of the world , because we all have a lot of people who live in the neighborhood , and we 're going to go back to the information and the information that we have , and the money that we 're working on .
I was so lucky , so I was going to have a lot of help , and so I wanted to help people who were willing to help people in the country , in a very interesting way .
I have a message that you will see more and more and more and more and more and more of the world that you see in the world .
Thank you .
You might agree with the sound of sound .
It 's a good material , and it 's kind of a good material , and it 's not just about the car , but it 's not about the size of the day , but it 's almost like today .
There 's a lot of water on the street .
And especially if you 're on the bike , you know , you 're on your bike , you know , you 're not good for the car .
At the same time , it 's very easy to move around .
And this material is a little bit -- if we 're going to make a city of the city of the city of the city of the city , we want to be able to make a little bit of it .
The solution to this solution was to be able to use a lot of UNK .
And a lot of mammals , like a lot of a lot of these materials , they have a little bit of water on it , and it 's got a little bit of water that 's coming out of the water , and it 's going to take a lot of water , and it doesn 't have a lot of water .
The noise will disappear through those holes .
Because it 's quite a lot of space , and it 's going to disappear , so it 's very quiet .
And of course , it 's got a little bit of the way that this kind of thing is going to disappear .
What 's called UNK ? Look at the beginning of the road .
And when I started again , I was going to take a couple of them , and I was going to show you .
But they 're going to UNK your UNK glass , and you must .
And finally , it 's going to take more and more of them .
And sometimes it 's going to come out of the road .
Well , he 's got a bit of difference .
UNK Street is going to be a problem , but we know the solution .
And here you see here is the UNK of the materials that you see here .
And this is where we say , but there are a few different kinds of rules .
So , for example , there are a lot of things that are made from fossil fuels , and it 's more like that , if it 's a UNK , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it would be like , you know , it
And if you 're on the street , you get these materials -- we see them .
And to try to solve this problem , we thought about our own materials .
And if we can make this kind of material , then it might be able to understand the solution .
And so what we did was we put a little bit of a UNK , and we put them into a small , and we put these little pieces on them .
And so now there are a little UNK here .
You 're going to need a robot like this , a UNK machine -- you can use it .
And you can see that there 's a camera that 's going to be able to catch up , especially in a very long way .
And so what we 're going to do is we 're going to take a UNK and put it in a UNK , and we can walk around them , and we 're going to put them into the tiny UNK , and they 're going to be there .
And since I was there , I was going to show you a little bit of a UNK machine .
And so it 's a UNK device that 's really going to be able to run out of the machine .
And I put it in , and now I put it on to see what was going on .
This is what it looks like .
And we have a lot of experiments that we have in our lab .
We tested many things , and the government looked at us , and they decided , " It 's interesting , we should do this . "
The government was spent a lot of money to give us , and we did the same thing about 30 meters , and we did this kind of test test .
And so this is what we did . You see the experiments of doing it , and of course , it 's not going to be that way , and it 's not going to be able to do that .
And so many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many , many things that we 've been on this street .
We did this chemical experiment , and we took a lot of money , and use them to do a little bit of a mobile phone and test tests .
We can take a lot of them .
And , in fact , the idea of this experiment was , if we were going to use our journey on this street , we would put this robot on the road , and we would put it on the street , and we would put a lot of these people on the street , and we would have a lot of money on this journey , and that 's going to be a lot of money that 's going to take place for a year , and that 's going to be a lot of money .
So , the idea is that we built a material that was used by a UNK , and it was able to use a way to take a picture of the road , and it would be used as a way to move forward , so you can use it in a way that makes a lot of money , and use it to be able to make a lot of money and use a lot of money that would be used for a lot of time , and it would be used for a lot of money to do a lot of things that would be used for a lot of time , a lot of money that would be used for a lot of time , and use a lot of money to do a lot of money .
You 're going to be able to have a problem .
We see the same . Now , there 's a little bit of us now .
And in fact , I want to show you a little bit of what it 's going to be able to show you .
But you try to do that .
See , seriously , it 's good .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very different animal .
There are about 10,000 species of land on the planet .
The birds are just one of the most powerful ones .
And when you see a couple of birds , like , you know , it 's like , you know , you 're a man in your head , and it 's kind of crazy -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
I wanted to change the way that we wanted to change the way that I wanted to change the optimism of the birds , because they needed to know what was going on .
Let me tell you why .
First , why are they going to give us a different example of this ?
When I was 18 years old , he said , " I found a few birds , " and I found a few birds , and he said , " These are the people in the audience , and they 're always going to be UNK in the spirit of the liver . "
You know , it 's hard to find something that 's more painful than that , and it 's not just Charles Darwin .
You know , it 's going to change me in the U.K. and then change his view , and I 'm going to tell you why .
UNK have been used to be seen as a UNK , as a UNK , as a result , as a symbol of the human spirit .
And recently , if you 're willing to meet the latest story of the European Union , it 's called the " UNK " to a UNK , UNK UNK . But I want to call it out .
I asked why . You know what ?
Because the country has not been able to maintain the environment .
You can 't be able to take care of the disease .
It 's almost never going to be a UNK .
And they were very far away .
And this is what I like to say , a couple of birds , a lot of joy .
There are two types of neurons in the world .
The new birds of new birds have lived in the United States , like in America , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , about seven million birds , and there are about seven of them , and there are about seven of them , and there are about seven of them , and there are about seven of them .
So why do we say that a few birds do , in a way , a lot of birds do not make a difference . They fail to change the environment .
The birds are our natural environment .
They 're going to put them into the UNK of the body .
They can take care of bacteria , and they can absorb the UNK of the virus and the patient and the patient and the patient and the patient and the patient .
The recent study that we found was that there were about two million communities , and the amount of things that were used to do more than three years ago , this was going to be more likely to provide information and to give them a lot of opportunities for them to give us a lot of opportunity to support and to provide a lot of opportunities .
And there are many other kinds of things about birds .
They 're related to UNK and UNK culture .
You know , it 's a lot of the software that we have , like , UNK , like the UNK of the UNK and the UNK of the UNK of the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK of the UNK .
In the middle of the city , a UNK of birds , and he was obsessed with a man who was born in 10 years of UNK , who was born on the planet .
In the Western culture , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , there are no materials , and there are no materials , and so it 's not about being used by a kind of UNK system , so it 's about a kind of UNK system that 's going to provide a huge amount of body system .
So where are the birds that are there ?
And it 's about seven million birds , six of them , six of them .
And a lot of birds , and the reason for that is , because in Kenya , the people of the people that were happening in the history of the people , and people use drugs that were used as a way of living in the body , and the animals were being killed by the animals , and the birds were being killed by the animals that were being killed by the animals that were being killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the animals that were killed by the patient , and the animals were being killed .
In the South Pole , a country has been around for India and UNK , and it means that they will be about 10 percent , and they 're going to die for about 10 years , and it 's because of the birds that are being used to eat the meat of the liver , and it 's been used as if the obesity of the birds are being used to eat a lot of drugs .
Now the drugs that we have today are now being used to be used to be used to use India , India and India .
Because , for example , the number of birds , it 's starting to have a huge amount of areas that are being used in the museum , in a UNK region , and the disease is like when you 're lucky , you know , when you 're lucky , you 're going to lose a lot of time , you know , when you 're lucky , you 're going to lose a lot of time , you know , when you 're lucky , you know , when you 're lucky , you 're going to lose a lot of time , and a lot of the amount of things that are happening in India is that it 's about 10 percent of the likelihood that there 's a huge amount of increase in India that 's happening in India .
Kenya is going to be able to use the largest model of Africa in Africa , and it 's going to be about 35 or 30 degrees Fahrenheit , and it 's going to be used by UNK UNK .
And I didn 't even think about it , but we should be thinking about the government of the government , because the crisis of the crisis of the crisis , the number of people who were going to be happy to the UNK , the number of neurons would be about two percent of the people who were going to be about to form a threat to the size of the obesity , and the number of people who were going to be put together with the UNK of the birds , and the number of people who were going to be put together with the UNK of the birds , and the number of people who were going to die would be about two percent of the people who would put them on the liver , and it was about two and a half , and a half of them would be saved by the UNK of the bird , and it was about two and a half and a half , and it would be about half the size of the size of the bird Sea , which was about two and a half , and the
And so it 's very simple .
In the West , some of the people who didn 't want to sell to sell their needs to sell and UNK would have been used for surgery and UNK .
So what are we doing ? We 're looking at this , and we 're using them to take care of them .
And we tried to look at different kinds of relationships in the environment .
And we found that people would walk around in different countries , so if they were looking for a local area , you were hard to know what to do .
We need to move away from all the government around the whole region .
We 're trying to connect people with local communities .
And we 're trying to figure out the benefits of the birds and have a sense of what we feel about , and what it 's going to do is to feel the kind of thing that we have to do with what 's happening to them and what they 're doing to do with them and what they 're doing .
What can you do ? You can put together , you know , and you can write about your government and tell them , we need to focus on people who are interested in the same way that people tell you about them , and you can tell you about the people that you can relate to .
And when you walk into this room , you 're a couple of birds , but don 't tell you about your family , but also about the stories of your neighbors .
And so what they did was they did that , but Charles Darwin said that he changed the way he saw a man in the air that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the space that he saw in the sky
Kenya , all around the world , there will be a huge amount of damage .
Thank you very much .
We live in a way that we can take a lot of different ways to help us live much better .
And we can 't really often see our neighbors , and even if we live in the same time that we live in the same public space that we live in the same time that we live in the same time that we live in the same time that we live in the same time that we live in the same time that we live in the same time that we live in the same time that we live in the same time that we live in the same time that we live in the same time that we live in the same public space .
And so , in the last few years , I was trying to do this in a different way , to make a different kind of way , like a paper and a piece of paper , and I was going to share a lot of things about each other in public space .
How much of these projects come from my own ? How many of my neighbors do ?
How do we get people into the audience and ask the question of what 's happening between them ?
How do we get better ?
How can we tell ourselves about our communities and our communities that we need to connect to our communities ?
I live in New Orleans and really love this city .
The things that live in the environment is that they were able to really be able to kind of look at my UNK , UNK , UNK and even UNK of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the day .
You know , when someone 's going to die , I feel like a UNK guy .
New Orleans has a very beautiful building in the world , but she 's also about the city of the city in the city .
I live in this room , and I want to figure out how it 's going to be a better place to think about other things that have changed my life .
In 2007 , I lost a friend of mine .
Her name was her name , and she was kind of like my mother , and she had a whole lot of people who didn 't exist .
And I think a lot of people about dying of death , and I think that this kind of thing that I was about to do with that was that I had a lot of attention to what was happening in my life and what we found out there was something that was really happy to me .
But I was very hard to keep this kind of activity in the sky .
And I think the people that people would have a lot easier to do , and remember what was really important about them ?
And I spent a lot of new friends in a couple of new friends , and I wanted to put on a UNK on the floor of the city , and I thought , " So , you know , I think , you know , I think , you know , you know , each of these people , I think , is going to be able to take a different kind of experience , and I think , each of us will be able to take a different kind of experience , and put them into a different kind of space that 's going to be able to share some of them feel that they live in public space , and they 're going to share them with a lot of people that they live in public space , and they 're going to share them with a lot of people that they live in public space , and they 're going to share them with a lot of people that they live in public space , and they 're going to share them with a lot of people that they live in public space , and they
I didn 't know who was going to come out of this experiment , but second , the whole wall was filled with the whole wall .
I want to share some people share some people in the wall .
And in my death , I thought , " I want to be part of my UNK behavior . "
" In the past , I want to move around the country . "
" In the past 10 years , I want to sing a hundred thousand people in the audience . "
" In the past , I want to be a tree . "
" In the past , I want to live alive . "
And I thought , " I want to give her a while . "
And I thought , " I want to be a man with a man who wants to be a man ? "
I wanted to do something in the dead before .
And the idea of this future is that it 's going to be a really different way of thinking about this , and it makes me happy to me , and it makes me happy to me , and it 's also what I mean by the time that I want to remind you .
It makes us believe that we are not alone .
Let 's face the news about the new house .
This is the way that we built a UNK and thinking that was asked us to change the way we change the process of change , and that 's the most important part of the process .
The black hole I was going to do , and I was going to show you a little bit of what was going on in their communities , and I was going to have a small tool that I was going to do , and I was going to share a little bit of this wall that I was talking about , and I was going to show you a little bit of a model of what 's happening in the communities , and I 'm going to show you a little bit of a picture of what 's happening in the city of the city , and the walls of the South Pole has been around , and South Africa and South Africa .
And so , for example , if we can have a means that we can all be able to connect people with people who can share a lot of people who share things with each other ?
And so the most powerful thing that we have , and it 's the same , is the time between the question , and the connection between the person and the rest of the person .
And in this case , in this case , the amount of human effort in this case , remember , remember , the experience of life was about living , and it was more important to remember what was going on in life .
And so we were never going to talk to us about having a UNK conversation that we didn 't want to die , but I realized that the death of death was going to be one of the most powerful things we could do .
You might think about death , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know yourself .
And it 's really important to do that , and it 's really important to think about , and it 's really important to the personal community that we have , and the people that we have , and the people that we have , we can help , to help us create a better place to help us make better life better .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I grew up on a different scale in the region .
It 's very hard to take care of the air . It 's pretty hard to see people on the bottom .
I can feel the people that I would like to live in front of us , but in the next dark , I can 't see anything else .
You know , I heard about all the people that were saying , well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And by the way , I was going to have a pretty bright amount of experience , and I was going to do a UNK of a UNK UNK on the street , and I was going to take a tree on the wall of the wall on the walls of the wall , and I was going to take a tree of the trees on the wall , and I would put them on the wall , and put them into a plastic bottle of light on them .
I got a little bit of my bones , you know , a lot of the tools that I 'd like to leave you with a couple of days ago , and he was wearing a little bit of a UNK of the sky .
And when I stand here with a talk to you about this room , it 's not about living in this space , but it 's not about , you know , there 's no difference between them , and you 're not there .
And I ended up doing this because I was able to get home , and I was going to be able to share this day .
In the last 25 years , I 've been able to take a picture of culture in the last 25 years , and I 've been so fortunate to be able to put on the island of 10 or 50 years of going to be able to figure out what 's going on inside the street and the UNK .
And where I met a lot of people , I met a lot of people , and I met a group of people from a UNK who was a UNK organization that was diagnosed with us as a modern social society .
And we talked about slavery , and I started to really understand the reality of this , and I was told that there was no serious difference in the world .
And when we talk about it , I felt that it was so sad that I didn 't know , and I was asked , " How many people do not know who I don 't know ? How many people do not know ?
And I was sitting on a UNK , and I was going to go back to Los Angeles , and I was going to go to see the UNK in Los Angeles , and I wanted to see what was going on .
And it 's starting to see the journey of the future .
The strange thing about that is that I was there .
I was asked them to be my second one .
But again , I 'm going to take a look at the secret .
And by the way , the data has been around for about 70 million people in the world today .
The number is , in fact , the number of people who were being asked by the American Union in the city of Africa .
And 15 years ago , a farmer of a farmer took about three times a year in the United States .
That 's about 25 million dollars today .
But today , the whole family has been only about 18 percent of the value of the world .
And the exciting thing about this is that it 's about three billion dollars a year on the global scale .
Many of them , many of us who have been trained to say , " The education of the education , " and the number of people who were being told that , " and the jobs of a man who 's been used to be done by the fact that it 's not being done by the fact that it 's not being done by the fact that it 's good for violence , and it 's not going to be done .
Today , the good news about agriculture today is about business and media , but it 's about people who create value value .
The amount of things that you have on the planet is that it 's not possible that it 's about anywhere in the world .
In India and Nigeria , I was arrested .
And so , you know , there are emotions like that , you know , like , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And in the size of a small piece of paper , women , on the other hand , a whole bunch of people on the table , a whole bunch of people on the top of the table , and they moved on to about 10 percent , and then they moved on to about 10 percent , and then they moved on to about 10 meters on the other side of the day .
You know , you know , it 's hard to take care of this , and it 's pretty hard to see them in the same way that it 's going to be about seven hours a day , and it 's about seven hours a day .
You can 't put yourself alone , you can 't eat , but you can 't have to hide them in the same way that they didn 't want to do that , and they didn 't really need to do it .
And so the problem with this is that it 's not going to be able to do this kind of thing that we had to be able to do a little bit of this .
And I was going to take about 20 minutes , and I had to put it on my hands , and put it into space , and I wanted to look at it , and I was going to show you a couple of weeks , and I was going to take a look at this , and I was going to take a look at this , and I was going to show you a couple of weeks , and I was going to take a look at this , and I was going to show you a couple of weeks , and I was going to take a look at this , and I was going to show you a couple of weeks , and I was going to take a look at this , and I was going to show you a couple of weeks , and I was going to take a look at this , and I was going to show you a couple of weeks , and I was going to take a look at this , and I was going to show you a couple of weeks , and I was going to
And back to the conflict , I didn 't want to wake up , but I was asked by the fact that God was going around , and he said , " UNK UNK . Don 't get me here . "
And he explained to me about what was happening in this place that was really dangerous to me , and for those people , for those people .
I didn 't have a way to give them to help them .
I can 't give them money . I just won 't .
I 'm not a citizen of that country .
My behavior may have been possible enough to put them into the environment .
I was just going to show you about UNK UNK , and I was able to figure out how they could do that , and I was sure that they could do that .
And I said , you know , I had to return to you , and I was going to return to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And at the same time , I saw a boy that I was working on the street with a couple of weeks , a couple of weeks ago .
And the kids who were there would be the kids who were working on trees , and they would put them on trees , and they 'd put them on the other side of the building , and they would put it on his head .
Now , the idea of this is kind of a kind of a UNK thing .
How do we make this kind of crazy ? What are you talking about ?
Some people didn 't even think that they were just about seven times a day , and they didn 't have to be six times because they were going to be able to do this kind of thing .
There 's no more opportunity .
And if these people would want to put themselves in the freedom of the freedom of freedom , they would have all the people .
And so these people , and they wanted to give up , and they wanted to give up a picture of what was happening in the area of the city , and they moved into the same way that they would put together in the same way that it was about , and it was about as if we would put it in the same kind of way , but in the same way that we would put it in the same way that it was possible and it was about , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The idea is that we were listening to us when we were listening to the fact that I was being told by the fact that I was inspired by the fact that I was inspired by the fact that I was inspired by the fact that I was inspired by the fact that I was inspired by the fact that I was inspired by the fact that I was inspired by the fact that I was inspired by the fact that I was inspired by the fact that I was inspired by the police , and I was hoping that I was taking care of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city .
I lived in love with a man , and I was a man who was born with women .
And now they brought me down to the next chapter in the next chapter room , about a UNK landscape .
This is not a UNK .
It 's more like a restaurant .
You know , it 's not about being used by the UNK .
A small space , the women and women and women and women and women who were killed more food and a lot of food and a lot of food .
And each one of these little space is really quite a bit of a UNK wall , and it turns out to be about three or four degrees of space .
People in this work will be willing to hurt people 's lives .
And remember , a couple of days ago , when I was a black view , I was a UNK , and I was thinking about what was going on in this room .
And here 's just one of this : It 's about my next second .
They didn 't get there .
It 's not going to be a window .
These guys are never going to run away from us , and the important thing about this is that it 's important to know whether or not , when you 're interested in our backyard , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
You know , thousands of people were not being done by a farm , and the family didn 't really do that .
And recently , the New York Times report was about 10 million children on the United States .
These things happen in our bodies , and we just don 't know .
And it turns out to be that we heard that we were very interested in the process of labor .
I was in India in India , and I was asked to be a member of the people in India .
It 's a family of people .
That 's the father of the UNK of the UNK and the UNK of the family .
And so they put it in the space , and they put them on the surface , and you put them into the desert , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
Let me tell you about their story .
" We didn 't have to be , " they said .
" We want to hope , and that 's probably going to be able to take a place where it 's going to be able to take the rest of the rest of this room and put it into the other places . "
And so , for example , there are more than 400 children on UNK who have been on the planet , and the largest picture of the world is the world 's worst of the world .
And so we got there , and I was going to see a big prize .
I see a man who 's a UNK , a little kid , a little bit of a little kid , sort of like ...
Well , they 're about charity .
The kids were arrested , and they were sold to sell , and they didn 't work on them , but they didn 't do it before .
This little boy is eight years old .
And when we do that , when we do that , he 's looking at the robot , he 's looking at his feet in the way that we 're going to put them on his feet .
And he was scared of water .
And when the rains are , you know , a lot of trees in this room are going to be able to take these trees , and the kids can get into the water to see them in the water .
Many people died .
And he was starting to do that , and he was starting to do that .
He was very sad , and no longer -- he was being beaten by a man who was being used by a man who was so used to be more or less healthy than other than his other way .
I saw these kids in the first couple of these boys , and they started working on the edge of the summer , and they started to work together .
In this case , the night of the night .
You know , it 's got to know that these UNK , there are thousands of them on them .
I 'm going to show you a little bit of this .
He 's been asked by a UNK man .
You see that he 's now in a place called UNK UNK who 's a place in a place called UNK .
And so , in this picture he 's doing that he 's working on a UNK , and it 's really good for the guy that it 's about -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
You can see that there 's a possibility of possibilities .
And the reason for that is , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can change the future .
And then the bus was on a road on the front of the road , and the man on the same axis , the number of people on the same axis , the number of people on the same axis , the number of people that we would have on the street , we were able to make a car that was really going to be able to make up a car , and we would have a car that was really going to be able to walk into the street , and the window of the car was going through the street , and the window of the car was going through the street .
And he asked us to take a look at the same direction .
In the road , it 's almost like us .
And then he said , " It 's not obvious that you can 't see , and it 's like , " It 's this . It 's got it . "
And so we started to take a picture of the road , and we got a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a UNK UNK that I put out of the street , and I put them into a UNK of the UNK .
It 's about two hours of UNK , and we can see that there 's a whole bunch of holes in the space , and there 's a whole satellite that 's kind of a kind of UNK in the ocean , and there are about a whole kind of coal that 's kind of a kind of a UNK street that 's being on the street .
A lot of women UNK their own kids , and they put them on the top of the liver .
And the water is used for gold .
These people are being done in the office .
And when they arrived , they were UNK .
And I remember that they were surrounded by the eye , and a lot of them have been waiting for about 12 hours .
And so , there are about 10 meters of these things , and they 're starting to figure out where they 're wired to be able to be able to move into another region , and we 're going to be able to take a different area where they 're used to be used to be able to put it into a different area , and they 're going to be able to take a different area and be able to improve it in a different area .
And so , in a way , the poor men , and the men , we found out that there was a lot of people who have found that there was a lot of people who were there , and there were some kids that were there .
They 're the victims of the disease .
And in fact , these muscles and the men in the age are probably going to be able to take a look at the person and the patient and the UNK .
This is UNK . When his father died of his father , he bought himself to sell himself to his job .
And at the end of his uncle , UNK was going to come out of his uncle , and he 'd been working on a job .
And I saw him when he was in a village , and he 's got a leg in Los Angeles , and he 's got a lot of time when he 's got to be in the business of the city , and you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , you know , when you 're in a business , you know , when
And by the way , he 's got sick , and even though , he 's going to do that every day .
And so , for example , he 's also thinking about being able to support information from UNK , which is the way that you can take care of them , and it 's kind of -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
I hope that we gave them to the people .
And when I took a lot of my UNK , I took a lot of UNK , and I put them on my bones , and I wanted to take a picture of what I wanted to do with them , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this , and I took a picture of this
They know about the people who know what it 's like .
And I wanted to make them know that we were going to do that , and we wanted to make them happen for them to make them happen .
And I really believe that when we put them in the same way that they do that , you know , they would be hard to eat this way .
And so these images are about the issues , about people who are people , and where you live a different kind of thing , a lot of dignity and a lot of dignity .
I didn 't want to say those beautiful things , but they didn 't wait for people , and people were going to see people that I was going to be able to see .
And I want these images to be able to kind of look at , and I hope that it 's going to be about energy , and I hope that it 's going to be that it 's not going to be the right to see if it 's not going to be the case of the human mind , because it 's not about the fact that it 's not about the fact that it 's not about the fact that it 's not about the fact that it 's not about the fact that it 's not about the fact that it 's not going to be on the street .
Thank you .
I mean , I learned that the scientists , I think , have a special problem in every way that I think is a particularly interesting problem , and that 's the kind of thing we need to do with a lot of science .
Nobody knows that we are .
So I 'm going to show you a couple of examples of what we 're going to do for you .
Well , dancing is about human activity .
We would expect to sing a lot of joy and dance and dance , and you know , you know , you know .
You know , it 's really important to know that there 's a lot of scientific evidence that you can 't see , and it 's going to be about as a result of what 's going on .
But , you know , it 's a disease system , a lot of mental illness , like a lot of UNK diseases , and it was happening at my friend of UNK , and he was born with a friend of mine that he 'd been working on for the first time that he was in his life .
And these years , it was great for many years .
And yet , there are about six million people , and it 's got a disease , and it 's hard to say that there 's no doubt about it , and there 's a lot of what we need to do when we need to be able to figure out what we need to do , and we need to measure the tools that we need to be able to do that , and we need to measure the tools that we need to be able to do that , and we need to measure the tools that we need to be able to do that , and we need to measure the tools that we need to be able to do that , and we need to measure the tools that we need to be able to do that , and we need to measure the tools that we need to be able to do that , and we need to measure the tools that we need to be able to do that , and we need to measure the tools that we need to be able to do that , and we need to measure the tools
What we need to do is to see them , and we need to know where to see , if we have a sense of what 's going on , where we have the ability to answer the question .
But the global economy is , it 's not that many other animals , and it 's not really -- you can 't do it ; you can 't do it ; you can 't do it , but the best you can do , it 's like that , like , you know , it 's the best way you can do that , and so the best you can do , it 's like that , like , you know , you can 't do that , like , you know , you know , you can 't do that , but you can 't do that , like , like , you know , you know , you can 't do that in a very small way , and we can do that , like , you know , like , you know , you know , you can 't do that in a very small way , and we can do this in a very small way that you can 't see , like , you know , like , you know , you know , you can 't do that , like , you know
You have to get people , and it 's not going to be so happy when you 're going to do that , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
But how do you treat the patient ?
And then , you know , how do you feel like patients , if you want to be able to experience someone to be able to do this experiment ?
You don 't need a lot of money to sell them .
And by the way , if you 're going to do that , you know , if you want to do that , you know , for example , it 's about 30 cents a year .
So I want to show you a very simple way of thinking about what we 're going to try to do , because you know , for example , at least in some sense , where we are , like , my friends are the art of a kind of art of mine .
I 've got a video of UNK .
And the people that we think that we want to take care of us , and when we think about ourselves , we thought about the sound of music that we had to do , and we did that , and , in fact , these were the people that we were working on , and indeed , these were the things that we were working on , and indeed , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of ,
And the same thing , as you know , as a UNK , it 's going to be trained for AIDS .
You can imagine , for example , a lot of time .
From the sound of sound , we can all be able to take away from the sound of the sound of the future , and it can influence us with our legs , and it can affect us .
You can see that the size of the bottom line is a kind of a UNK .
And we see the same kind of symptoms .
Voice : UNK , UNK and UNK .
It 's going to be a little bit more powerful than when you get a little bit more information about it .
And , in fact , for many , many , many , you know , when I was asked , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And so these words are based on infrastructure , and they 're going to do a lot of research , and what they 're going to do is , you know , how are you going to do that ? Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how are you going to try to build a space ? No , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , how do you make a difference ?
And the idea of neuroscience is that it 's not possible , and it 's all about the infrastructure there .
You don 't have to design a different hospital .
And they all agree . They said , well , it 's not just about speech , but it 's not about religion .
And that means that the patient 's own , you know .
And it 's much faster , much more than 30 seconds .
The price price , and we know how to do it .
You can do it in a price , and it 's probably going to be able to scale up .
I 've got a little bit of what I can do with you .
And we can reduce the problem between the patient and the patient .
You don 't need to learn to do anything about it .
We can make a lot of money that 's used to be able to figure out how to make it work .
And we can use a solution to experiment , and it 's very easy , and we can make a number of rules that we can achieve .
We also have a chance to start thinking about this disease as a kind of disease .
So , from the beginning of the day , we started to see the first step , and we started UNK UNK .
And what we 'd like to do is write a piece of UNK , and we want to record the number of the world 's data , and we 're going to show you about a couple of them , and it 's going to take care of the world 's data , and it 's going to take care of these people in this room , and it 's going to take care of these people in this room , and it 's going to take care of these people in this room .
We have about 10 million people on the planet , and it 's about 10 million people on the planet .
And any of us as a healthy disease or a healthy disease , and a lot of money , a lot of money , a lot of money , a lot of money -- and I was really happy that I was going to be six percent of our time , and we got about 80 percent of the time that we found that we were about eight percent of our time .
Thank you .
So , you know , it 's not that many things that you might have said , well , you might be able to remember who was a healthy person , who was a healthy patient ?
What do you think about these things ?
Yes , yes . So , you know , you know , it 's kind of like , you know , when you 're told that you 're not going to be a disease , you know .
You know , some people will never give us , or we can 't .
But we 're going to have a very different environment , because it 's not a different environment , because it 's not really what we can take away from this kind of environment .
So , how much are you today ?
It 's gone away .
And in fact , my students , I was going to mention him because he was able to figure out what was happening in the network of the Internet , so it was going to be able to move into the Internet , so it was going to be able to figure out how it 's going to happen to the next 25 years , so now we 're going to see that in the next phase of the Internet , so now we 're going to go to the end of the end of the Web .
Well , OK , that 's not good .
And so this means that people can put them on them -- they can do it in a way that you can do with them , and then they can tell each other , and then , when they 're in , you know , you know , when you 're in the room , you can see them , you know , when you 're in a way to learn about them , and then when you 're able to do that , you know , you can see them , you know , when you 're going to learn , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , when you
That 's it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I 've been able to take a picture , and I 've been able to show up , and I 'd like to share with you about 15 minutes of my favorite picture , and they didn 't have to be part of me .
There is no art , no copyright , no chance , and even a little bit more .
In fact , most of them are UNK .
And my story was going to talk to me about New York City , my wife , my wife , and I was five years old , and we were about to be about five or five years of the year .
And by the end of a year , we went to New York City , so we decided to build a different picture .
And you can see what 's happening .
You know , when I was five years old , the wife said , " Hey , you know , why don 't you want to do that in New York , for example , for example , in the book of New York ? "
And that 's what we 're starting to do with the streets of the street .
You know , the camera , the camera , the camera , the number of people , is a very different story .
No one 's ever going to end up , but no one of us was never going to take our camera .
At that time , we didn 't know how this journey to change our lives .
And for us , it 's getting worse .
And this is what I was trying to do when I was trying to do this in the first couple of weeks , and I was going to try to explain this to the next 15 years of the way that I was going to show you about five of these young kids .
And so these pictures are not just recorded a bit of a challenge , or a special journey .
It 's a way of looking at the way that we really want to live in a week , let 's go back to the next couple of years , and we 're going to change that in the next 10 years , but in the same way , not only changes in the body , but in the body of the body , it 's about changing change in the body .
Because I took a picture of the year , and we looked at each other , and we had a new process , and I was looking at her eyes , looking at her response , how to look at it .
This is a time when our kids are , and we are the first time in the first year .
And last week , we were walking around the street , and she stopped getting a red , she was kind of a UNK , and she was kind of like she was happy to see that she was going to start a journey in a way that was really good for us .
And she 's suffering when I 'm about five years old , and she 's suffering about this picture .
And she said that she was going to come to see the first time she was going to come out of this place , which was the decade of the year .
And now she 's talking about the city of New York City , because she decided to go to New York .
And I suddenly realized that we created our own memory .
So I 'd like to share a way of thinking about how to create memory .
I didn 't know about you , but I didn 't know about 15 pictures , but I would never show up on home .
I 'm always the guy who 's trying to take a camera .
And I want to encourage you now in the audience , to the picture , to the picture , to the next man , to the next man , to ask , " How can we take that picture ? "
Thank you .
