And when I was 11 years old , I 'd wake up a morning , and I wake up , and I was going to hear a happy voice .
My father was using his UNK radio radio .
He 's wearing a smile , and it 's so rare , because most of all of them have to be very frustrated about that .
" UNK , " he said .
I don 't know what that means , but I can see the father 's really happy .
" You can get a real school book , " he said .
I never forget that morning .
It 's a real school .
When I was six years old , I was a school in college , and I think that the girls are not illegal .
So when I was five years old , I was a woman who 's in my sister who 's going to get rid of my sister , and it 's not allowed to be independent out of my sister .
And this is the only way to communicate with our children .
We 're going to see different ways that we don 't want to ask us where we 're going to go where we want to go .
We put books in food in the food , and it 's going to get us just to get there .
school in a room , more than one of us in a small room .
The winter is very uncomfortable , but a summer is hot .
And we all know that we 're going to be the risk of life , teachers , students , and they 're all understood .
Sometimes there 's a couple of years later , there are schools , because they 're happy .
We 're always worried about what 's going on .
Are we going to do it ?
They know where we are ?
We were scared , but we still want to school .
I was fortunate to grow up in a public education , and I love a family .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man in his age .
He was in Afghanistan , and he served his daughter , and he 's going to help his daughter , and his mother , and he 's going to get his father from his father 's father .
But my mother became a teacher .
And there he is .
She 's four years ago , and he 's going to be a school , and he 's a school girl , and women and women .
My father -- that 's it -- he 's the first one in his family .
So there 's no question , because he 's going to be educated , including his daughter , even though he 's in his school , and there 's no risk of risk .
And for him , the child has no education as much as education .
When I was there , I remember that my life is going to be the fear of my life , and I remember that he 's going to be afraid of the future , and that doesn 't really see the future .
And I wanted to leave it out , but my father would say , " Listen , my daughter , you can lose any of your life .
You could be rejected , you could get away from the back of town .
And the only thing you can get into the care is that it 's here , if we don 't have to sell our kids to pay attention , we won 't get any of our money .
And how do you want to continue ? "
I 'm 22 years old now .
I grew up in a couple of years of war that were killed by a few years of war .
I grew up in the age of my age high school students from high school because of my family , and if it wasn 't about most of my life , I 'd be like a lot of people .
And I 've now been a proud academic school student .
When I went back to Afghanistan , when I came back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , when I was a child in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , in the United States in America , and I showed a lot of attention to it .
He 's not alone because of my college experiences , because in women , I 'm a first time , and I 'm the first guy in the back of the woman , and I 'm the first person to drive him in the streets of Florida .
And my family believed me .
My dreams were so big , but they were so much better for me .
And this is why I became a global version of the world , and this is a global organization about women 's community .
And that 's because I 'm part of the fact that the first part of the book I 'm involved in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , all the women who are in Afghanistan , where they are still dangerous .
I 'm excited about what I saw my students in school , and I saw the opportunity to the students who could be happy .
And I saw them all the time , and my father 's like a father , and if they support me , they looked at fear .
So , for example , Steve , this is not true , and I can 't tell you what he is , and he 's a father of mine .
But a month ago , he and his daughter were in the way that he died in the school , and they were going to die at the end of the road .
And he said , " You know , it 's time for me to get a voice message later , and if he 's going to go to school , he 's just going to happen . "
" If you think about that , you can kill me now , " he said , " but , but he said , " Well , but I 'm not sure that you die in the future of my daughter and the future of my daughter . "
And in Afghanistan , I realized -- that 's what the West says that if it doesn 't really realize what 's going on in the end of what we 've been doing to realize that the thing that we 've learned from our success is that in the end of our success , can recognize the success of the woman that he can recognize , and what he can see is his own success , is his own success .
It 's not about mothers that our success is not important for us .
In fact , as a child 's future of girl , they usually are the most likely to meet the power of care , but in the society that we need , and we have to have sex support .
And in UNK , the girls who went to school had a few of them -- don 't forget , but it wasn 't .
But today , Afghanistan is now about 300 million children .
Afghanistan is very different from America .
I discovered that the Americans can see the vulnerability that we evolved .
I 'm worried about this change in the United States who 's going to be able to do so long .
But when I came back to Afghanistan and saw my students and support them , and I saw the future of the future , I saw this change going to continue .
For me , Afghanistan is hope for peace and survival , every day , every single day in UNK , every day , every single day .
Like me , they have big dreams .
Thank you .
What I 've done is that it 's not my whole life , but it 's a huge impact on my life in Africa , and I 've seen a lot of what I 've been doing in the last seven years of my life .
From 17 years old years ago , I was really young , but I was so young , and I was so young , and I was in Australia , and I was in Zambia , and I was in Zambia , and I was in Zambia , and I was in fact , and I was in the Middle East , and I was in Kenya , and I said , " I 've got a problem with UNK , and I 've been in the late East , and I 've lived in Africa , and I 've lived in Europe and all of the different projects in Africa .
I was in a very different project in Africa , and we failed every single project in Africa .
And I 'm very excited .
When I was 12 years old , I think we were very good , and we were doing a great job in Africa .
Well , we 're going to figure out what to do .
And the first project I wrote to write is a book called " UNK UNK " in this project , and we now know that most of us need to teach people 's food .
So , we 've taken a lot of what 's going on in the south of the South East , a UNK valley , and we 're talking about the fact that most of us need to look at the West and the West and the West and the West and the West .
Well , of course , people are really interested in the audience , so we pay attention to work , and they 're not going to be there .
There 's a lot of UNK , and there 's a lot of fear , and we 're very surprised with that .
But we don 't ask them , and just to tell the reason , just like " Come on us . "
" When the hunger of starvation is something that 's going to spread out of the hunger . "
Well , of course , in Africa , it 's good .
There 's a great thing . It 's a great part in Italy , and it 's a red , and it 's too big , and it 's too big .
It 's unbelievable . We talked to people who said , " Look , a lot easier . "
When the UNK come up , the red is really cool , and a night and a half from the West Bank are all made out of all of them .
And we said to them , " Oh , my God , " God ! "
People said , " Yes , that 's what we don 't have in Africa . "
" Why don 't you say , " Why don 't you say " ] , " and do not ask . "
And I think that we can actually tell people about the fact that Americans live in Africa , but if you look at the United States in America , when you look at the Americans , they are very proud of what we 're doing .
Because , at least , we ate the river .
You should all look at these UNK -- you 'd like to see how many trash people are doing so , how many of the parasites are , of course .
You can read this book , " The UNK and " the UNK , " he said , " UNK . "
This book is published in 2009 .
And we 're all in the country in the last 50 years , and there are two billion dollars in the country .
I 'm not going to talk to you about this money .
You want to read and read .
Look at the face of African women 's eye , and what we 've brought is a lot of people .
And we are the UNK of the UNK , and the UNK , and we 're talking about UNK UNK .
These are two words from " UNK " in " UNK . "
But there are two words .
And the guy who said , " The UNK of the world " to me , of course , " and " I love your kids . " I love your kids . "
At the end of my life , the people who made a cultural background were doing what I was doing .
And that 's why the African people are called " aging , " and that 's the boss .
When I read a book , a book called " The UNK , " because a few years ago , and if people don 't want to ask someone 's help , they 're not going to do it .
This is supposed to help the help of aid .
The first cause of aid is to respect .
And one of the great things that happened to this day today is to take a look at the center and say , " We can 't -- you can 't imagine a city that 's not going to be UNK by the city ? "
And 27 years , I made a decision about what people need , and what I 've been doing is , we don 't really need to be a job for people , and I don 't really need to be an idea of what people want to do , and I don 't really want to be a part of what people want to do , and I don 't really need to be an idea of what people want to be , and when people who are going to be able to do what they 're doing , and why people who are going to be able to help , and people who are going to be able to figure out what they 're going to do , and why people who are going to be able to help , and people want to get a good part of the people who are going to find a better life .
So we 're going to do it -- just shut up .
We 're going to go into a community where we 're not going to be able to get the idea of the place where people are sitting together .
Our work is not going to work .
And we share with the customers , and we see them in the restaurants .
We don 't have any infrastructure .
What we do is , they talk to them about their interest and their ideas .
And the most important thing is hot .
You can tell you your ideas .
But if you don 't do it more interesting , what do you have to do with it ?
And the client is the most important thing about me .
The hot thing about the place is to build a foundation that 's important , and that 's the most important thing .
And then we helped them search for knowledge and information , because of that , on the face , and not all the trees .
And there are a few things that don 't really know about knowledge , but we can support it .
So a lot of years ago , I have an idea that we shouldn 't be able to hear the ideas that we don 't have , and why don 't we value the idea of being able to share the form of society on society , but that 's not the form of society .
And I tell you a secret .
Social meetings are going to be a problem .
And the entrepreneurs never came out , and they weren 't going to tell you , they were going to tell you , they were able to figure out what they 're going to see .
So there 's a solution .
You don 't even have the smartest people in the community , because they don 't have to do with your public attention .
But what we do is , and we 're going to interact with the client , and we have to build a social infrastructure for all of the future .
We need to create a new job .
So , as part of the business of the entrepreneurs , the entrepreneurs ' family doctors , who are in your home room , where your kitchen table , or a restaurant , to help you get the information that 's going to change the way that you 're going to be able to communicate with you ?
I 've worked on the UNK UNK in Australia .
And I went to a Ph.D. , and I was trying to throw away the dog that had gotten used to the end , and then he could do it all the way down .
And my first year in Ethiopia , I gave him a family out of the room , and when I was a kid in the room , and I asked him to get a guy in the room , and I asked them to sell , " You know , I 'm going to get a member of this guy , and I 'm going to get a guy in the room and say , " You 're the guy who 's going to work with this guy ? Can you help ? "
I 'm going to do it all the way down to the United States , and I 'm going to buy a guy in the United States , and for about 50 dollars in the United States , and I 'm going to pay them all the time out of 10 dollars in the United States , and you can help them with them , " Hey , you 've helped them , can you help them ? "
A year ago , I made 22 projects , and the government came up and asked me , " How did you do this ?
How do you do it ? " And I said , " I did something very hard .
And he 's shut down , and they say it . "
So -- the government says , " And then . "
And we 're going to spread to 300 different communities in the world .
We 've helped to build 40 people .
And a new generation of entrepreneurs who are free , they 're all going to get out of the car .
Peter UNK , one of the greatest UNK of all the time , in the history of the history , a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago , six years ago .
And Peter UNK was one of the teachers , and Peter UNK once said , " The planning is really important for creativity and creativity . "
And a plan was to help to help .
Now , we 're all about the UNK UNK , and the people who don 't know what they 're going to use their own money and their skills .
We need to learn how to get these people .
We 've got to give them respect , and respect to our privacy , and we 're going to do what they 're going to do , and what they 're going to do is they 're going to pay attention for them , so they 're going to go to the door , and if they 're going to go to the door , and they 're going to go to the end of the people , and then they 're going to get the door , and if they 're going to go and down .
There are 200 people in one of the communities , and we have 2,000 customers .
How much can you imagine a community that are more intelligent and passionate about sex ?
How many of you have you please have to do this today ?
It 's all about creativity , and you 're happy for them .
So what I 'd like to say is that creativity is the trend of our society today .
When we 're in the end of the first time of the Industrial Revolution , we use something that is not going to be able to grow up fossil fuels , but we really don 't realize that this is happening .
There are a lot of fuel in the air fuel in the air .
Use the UNK food .
What we 're really concerned about is how we 're going to be able to get 70 billion people 's food , health , education , education , etc .
There 's another technology .
Who 's going to figure that the technology is going to be the green revolution ? You know ? Don 't want it !
Governments ? Don 't want it !
They are the entrepreneurs , and they 're really fighting right now .
And a lot of years ago , I saw a really interesting article about a magazine magazine .
In 1983 , there are experts who are invited to talk about the future of New York City .
And there are about 800 years old , and there are all over the New York City , and they 're all over 100 years , and they 're talking about 100 years , New York City , in the New York , New York City will not be done .
Why ? Because if they look at the curve , if people continue to grow up on the speed of the year , they 're going to be able to grow up with six million of them , and 60 million of them are going to be able to do it .
People are going to be UNK .
So , in 1960 , they thought , " Well , this is the dirty technology of the heart of life on the UNK of the New York Times . "
So that 's going to happen , and about 40 years , and there are about 100 and a half billion people in the audience -- there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more , and there are more ,
So there 's a new technology that comes out of a new technology , and it 's going to stop , and not too long ago , but not too much .
For example , UNK UNK in UNK .
Yet , with the creation of creativity , there 's a secret .
First of all , you have to give them condoms .
No , they 're not going to find you .
And then you 've got to focus on what they want to focus on .
You 've got to tell the truth of their creativity .
It 's not good for business , and it 's great to get the three things together , and the product is going to be great : the product is going to be good , and the market is going up , and the market is important .
What is the problem ?
It 's never happened as a human being able to do the job and the marketing and the financial jobs .
This person isn 't there .
This can 't happen .
So , we 've been doing this out of 100 people in the world , and there are companies companies in the world , and for example , for example , with the public sector , and you see , you know , you know , you know , you have the public sector company , the company , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK company , the company , the company , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK .
There are all successful businesses in the world , and there 's only one : there is no business that is one of the industry that has been created by one thing .
And we 're looking at the end of these students , and we 're looking at what the students are doing , and what they 're doing is , " How many of these students ] , " " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and " the word " and
I said , " No , " we use a UNK .
And he said he wasn 't very UNK .
No one is going to be alone . Nobody .
So , we can build a community where we 're from the community , and we 're going to get the tools in the private sector , and if you 're a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of an educational solution , and we might ask you , " What do you need ? "
What do you do ? Are you going to produce that ?
Can you sell it ? Do you want to finance ? "
" Ah , I 'm not . " " And that 's what I want you to do . "
We set up the community of community .
We have volunteers , and as we all know how to organize the culture that we have , and what we find out is that the people in the audience are able to create a sense of what 's going on in the way that we 're going to be able to change the culture of our society and the economy that we can do , and what we find is the power of people who are able to change the situation that they can use , and the power that we see is that the power of people who are going to be able to figure out how to change the world that we can use , and that 's the power that we have , and the power of our time , the way that we can use people to change the power of our lives , the way that we can use people to solve the power of our lives , the way that we can use people to solve the power of our lives , the way that we can use people to solve the power of our lives , the way that we can use
Thank you .
Five years ago , I had an experience with a lot of UNK .
I 'm going to tell you about a student who 's learning how to teach a teacher 's degree .
And I was terrified .
And I 'm really scared . And these students have an enormous brain , and they 've all used , and they 're all over again and so on .
But as a result of the conversation , my experience is like UNK , and there 's a lot of money going on here , and you can see the big door to a whole new world .
And that 's what I share with people who are hallucinations , and I want to think that other people can experience it in the context of the situation .
I 'm sure that the key to the door is to have good traffic and communication .
To change the world , we need to get better communication from our scientists and engineers .
And our scientists and our engineers solve all of the problems that we face , and if we don 't understand what we 're doing , and why we don 't understand what we 're doing , and I believe that we have a problem that we do not care of all of them , but also because of all of us who don 't understand what we 're doing .
And if our scientists and engineers aren 't going to look at what they look like , and we 're not going to be able to get a good traffic .
So scientists and engineers , let 's talk about what the technology is .
And I want to share with a few of these things that I want to tell you about what I think about how we can make your science , and tell you what I 'm doing .
And the first answer to answer is , what about technology ?
Tell us about why you 're so familiar with us .
Don 't tell me a little bit of the bone that I 'm looking at , to tell you a little bit about what I 've been studying , because that 's what 's happening to you , because the whole structure of the structure of the brain structure of knowledge and treatment is so important .
And the other thing that you 're about to describe the science is , you 're going to focus on language .
And the thing is , we understand what you want .
And of course , you can say , " The UNK of UNK , " but why not say " space is in the time " and " space , " and this is so easy to explain .
So let 's think of the idea of simplicity , and not so on .
Instead , as you can see , as love as being as a simple , you can imagine , you can probably be able to get better than that , but not .
You don 't need to change your way that your vision is going on .
You can think of some examples , stories , and some of them , and these are the ones that we 're excited about .
And there 's a couple of things you don 't have to do with your research on a slide . Don 't use a little bit of it .
Do you want to think of what is called " UNK " button ?
What 's the thing that 's going to get out of the car ? You can kill your talk .
Like this slide are not just about the language , but but also the language of our brains , we don 't know .
And this is an image of what 's called UNK UNK , and that 's because of the DNA tools that we 're talking about , again , again , again , again , again , the UNK of the UNK in UNK .
And what 's interesting about this is that if you 're a little bit of a few words , you 're going to be able to understand what 's going on , and what we 're going to do is we 're going to be able to tell you a little bit of what we 're thinking about , and what we 're going to do , and what we 're able to do , and to make sure that we feel a little bit more about what we think about what we think about what our minds are .
And these are the things that I think that we can help with a great deal of what 's going on in the center of the door , the science and the engineering and the engineering and the engineering question .
So because of my colleagues with my colleagues , I would tell you a little bit about how I felt , and I wanted to use a way to end up with a solution .
And the science that you 're looking up with your ideas about what you 're about , or what 's going on , what 's going to share with you about what we 're doing , and what we 're concerned with is you 're talking about what 's going on , and what people do to share with you , and if you 're a little bit about what you 're doing , and what you 're doing to share with you , and you 're focusing on what you 're doing , you 're focusing on what you 're doing , and you 're going to share a little bit of what you 're doing , and what you 're doing , and what you 're doing , and what you 're doing to share with you , and you 're focusing on what we 're doing , and what you 're doing , and what you 're doing , and what you 're doing , and what you 're doing to share with you , and you 're focusing on what you 're doing , and a lot of people who are concerned with what you 're
So , scientists and engineers , when you solve this approach , and think about it , and I 'm talking about the technology .
Thank you .
I loved the word " UNK . "
It 's not because it sounds good .
And it means " a UNK . "
And even though that 's just a good idea for the end of the 21st century , he 's going to be a good guy , and he 's not going to be able to pay attention , or whatever he 's going to get , or whatever he 's going to get into the United States , and he won 't pay attention . "
I don 't know what the UNK is .
It 's about the word of words and words , and I suppose .
But the language of the politics of politics is so important , and all the politicians , and all of them need to try to control their language .
And for example , until 17 years ago , there was an article about how to speak out on the war .
And it 's because of a brave man , and this great name is called UNK .
And he was lost by London , but he was very happy with the idea that he 'd be happy , but he won a lot of UNK for his support voice in London , and he won a lot to win .
And just a few years later , we had a first record on Twitter .
A lot of people think of what 's going on in this particular language .
It 's not that he 's coming out of a UNK UNK .
But to really understand what 's going on with the real word and politics , I want to take you back to the United States , and at the end of the time that it 's written .
And they had a problem , which is what they called George UNK , their leaders .
They don 't know .
What is it that says that what 's going on with the Chinese community ?
And this is a very long time in Congress .
And there 's a lot of advice , and there 's a lot of advice , and it 's all these ideas .
I mean , a lot of people want to say , " Well , a lot of people who say , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he called the UNK , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he 's called "
There is no name on the ground .
Some people just want to name him .
They think it 's something that 's used over and over and over again .
They don 't even have UNK , but their ideas are , you can choose to have a party in order to choose .
You know , that 's pretty much possible .
And every one of them is going to get wrong , because they 're all wrong , because of this argument .
I read a lot of a lot of time , and I read a lot of UNK , and it 's time for a lot of time , " and this is true . "
And the reason for this is that it 's the number of people who are fighting with the protests , and the people who are coming to the church .
And the audience doesn 't want to make any of the power of power .
They don 't want to call him a UNK or whatever he 's going to do .
So , they give him an idea of being able to think of , which is , of the smallest , and most of the most vulnerable words .
And this is called UNK .
UNK UNK . I mean , I 'm not doing this . I mean , this is true , but it 's a conference on a conference .
UNK the same thing .
And it wasn 't so very , very , very , very poor , " UNK . "
There are a lot of people who are going to be able to get some kind of UNK , and there 's some sort of thing that 's going to be , but it 's not all of a sudden .
And this is also why we 're talking about this guy .
And they say this one 's so crazy , you can 't call him UNK .
This guy 's been going to spread and meet .
Who 's going to think about him , if he 's just so stupid , if he said to me , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like , " he said , " he 's just like
And a couple of years ago , there 's no way back to the Taliban .
And as a result of the fact , for example , they 're not going to be able to identify the fact that they 're not going to be able to identify the fact that they 're not going to be able to identify the fact that they 're going to end up to the fact that they 're not going to be able to identify the fact that they 're going to end up to the fact that they 're going to end up to the fact that they 're going to end up to the fact that they 're going to end up in the wrong place that they 're not going to be able to do what they 're going on in the end of the country , and if they don 't have to be able to do what they 're going on in the end of the country , and if they don 't have any sense of what 's going on on the Internet , and if we don 't think about the most part of the language , and if we don 't think about the fact that we don 't think about
Now , you can see three interesting things in this story .
Well , first of all , I would like to get out of my own data , to find out what I 'm looking for is just as " president , " he never said .
UNK UNK , " UNK of the UNK , " which is , again , is still waiting for a moment in the classroom .
The second thing you can understand is that the U.S. government says that it 's just a real time to do it -- and it 's going to continue to grow up 23 years ' time .
But the third thing you can learn about this is that the most important thing you can do , and I 'm going to tell you about this is that it 's not really important to hear about it , because it doesn 't have to have a lot of attention , a very important idea of what 's going on here .
There are more than 5,000 dollars in the world , and there 's the largest economy in the world , and there 's a lot of money on the world to get the rest of the world .
This is an incredibly important question of what 's happening today .
So it 's going to win .
They 've got their own body heads .
And the other thing that 's been worried about is that this guy 's hearing sounds like a lot of weird -- oh , that 's because it used to be strange to hear that time .
But now , do you know how many countries have it today ?
UNK .
And it 's because they wanted to let their own hair sound like that there are about 500 UNK people , and so on .
So , at the end of the conference , because no one is going to tell them , because nobody 's going to tell them that they 're now paying attention to the United States in America .
And it 's important for me to learn that what you can learn , and I want to leave you with it .
And the politicians , the UNK and the UNK and the control of the dictionary and the control of the brain , but in fact , that reality is actually changing the way that you can change the form of words to change the way that you can change the form of words to change the way that you can change the form of words to change the way that you can change the form of words to change the way that you can change the form of words to change the way that you can change the form of words to change the way that you can change the form .
Thank you so much .
And when I was nine years old , I was nine years old , and I was 19 years old , and I was 19 years old , and I was 19 years old .
I was using my black UNK UNK , and I was wearing a UNK with a lot of UNK , and I didn 't think so well .
This is my first trip to Afghanistan .
When I grew up in the middle school in my war in the war room in my friends in the war room , six and a half of all of them were in the audience , and I was talking about the relationship between the family , and I was talking about the family 's room , and I said , " UNK , " and a half of the people who are going to work in and say , " UNK , " and a half of the people who are going to work in and say , " UNK , " and that 's all the way to do what it means to be like , " UNK the UNK , " and not all know what it means to be a UNK .
But that 's what I did .
So , I 'm here today , and I 'm in a state of Afghanistan , and I 'm in a state of UNK , and I 've been involved in Afghanistan , for the last nine years , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job , a job
And in Afghanistan , you can make a sense of what I 'm doing , you know , what I 'm really going to tell you about what I want to do , and what I 'm going to do is to create a position on what I 'm doing , and what I 'm going to do is to create a position on what I 'm doing , and what I 'm going to do is to create a position on what I 'm doing , and what I 'm going to do is to create a position on what I 'm doing , and what I 'm going to do is to create a problem on what I can do , and what I 'm trying to do , is to make a sense of what I really want to do , is to make a moral theory to understand what we 're doing to understand what our lives are .
I 'd like to talk to you about a Christmas part of the day that he lived in his face , and he 's going to do what he 's got to work with , and to make sure what to do with politicians and politics , to make sure that they can be rich with what they do .
And these UNK came out of the meeting , and they said to me , " Please , I 'm a UNK . "
I 'm trying to use a group of UNK to understand the UNK in the United States .
I 'd like to look at what I 've been doing , and the way that we can do this is to look at what 's called the UNK , and it 's about the streets of the streets of the streets and say , " Please , " they 're going to pay for the streets of the streets , and if they 're going to pay for the rest of their country , and tell them about the fact that they 're going to pay attention to the fact that we have the name of this country who 's going to be able to pay attention to the fact that we 've got to pay for this 10 to what we 've been able to do with this .
I wanted to figure out how to use it to my point to tell the conflict of conflict , to a conflict of conflict .
What I 've done is that the UNK of the UNK and the UNK of the UNK and the UNK in the UNK can tell you the UNK in UNK , for example , where I think of UNK as a UNK UNK .
And I also want to show you a little bit of an idea of what 's going on on the wall to look at the UNK of the UNK and the UNK of the people who are in the wall , and what they 're doing is that the people in the audience are responsible for food , even though they don 't understand what they 're doing .
But these things can be done when they 're going to go to them .
But I do what I 've got to do to do because I 've got to ask me to do something .
And that 's what I 've got to do . What do you do ?
Thank you .
Hi . I 'm a model in the last six years .
Actually , I did .
Now , I feel a little bit at this room , because I 'm not wearing this guy .
And I brought another thing .
This is TED today , at TED , and I think this is very lucky for me today .
And if there are some women who are so surprising about what I 've learned to tell me , I think I 'm going to tell you about what I mean , but I think it 's going to happen .
And I want to tell you that I 've been so lucky enough to be able to change my shape in 10 seconds .
It 's not all of people who can do it .
And these are UNK and bad news , but I 'm not going to get them on them .
And the worst news is that I 'm going to take this out of my head , and I 'm going to tell you why I 'm wearing my clothes because I 'm not doing anything .
You can .
So why do I do this ?
This is weird .
I hope that doesn 't seem to be that way .
You know , it 's a lot of big , but it 's also about it .
I was able to change myself in six seconds because you were thinking .
In this picture , I 'm actually in fact that there are no men in real life .
When a photographer came to me , and I was very uncomfortable with this guy .
And what 's going on with the surgery or two days ago , I actually couldn 't change the surface of what we were doing , and we basically don 't really change the surface , but we basically don 't really change the way that we use the surface that we have , and we basically don 't change the way that we use our lives , and we don 't really understand what we are doing .
So today , for me , a fear of change is going to be honest .
And I 'm here because I 'm a model .
I was in this stage because I was a beautiful white woman in our profession , and we call it " Sex . "
And I 'm going to answer the question that people often ask me , what are these questions ?
And the first question is , how do you become a model ?
And I said , " I 've been found , " but this is true .
And the reason I 'm a model is because I 've got a bad gene , and I 'm an UNK , and you might have a problem .
Well , at the end of the last few of the century , we 're not only about health in the past , and what 's going on in the past few of the world , is that we can tell the difference that we 're going to get out of the world , and we 've all been able to get into the things that we have in the past few years , and of all the different parts of the world that we have in the world that we have , and the things that we 're able to tell us about what the planet is , and the quality of the body , the UNK , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white skin , the white and the white
And this is my legacy . This is what I 've been doing .
I know that some of you might probably be able to get some of these people in this audience , as UNK , James and UNK .
Well , first of all , I 'm going to tell you what I 'm looking at .
But unfortunately , I 've got to tell you , when I started a New York college college in New York , there were only two , three percent of them , and that 's not the number of people who are in 2007 , and they 're all of them .
And a guy who asked me about my question is , " How do I do this ? "
And my first answer is , " I don 't know , because they don 't let me do this . "
But the second answer is , what I wanted to ask was , " Why ? "
You know what ? You can choose anything .
You can be the American president or the UNK , or a UNK , or a UNK , because you 're the first person .
And if it 's done , they say , " No , no , no , I think of UNK , and I said , " But my boss . "
Because I can 't decide anything that you can become American UNK or UNK UNK , or a UNK .
When you grow up too much , you think , as a result , you say , you grow up and say , " You 've got to win . "
It 's not going to be something that 's not going to be something that 's not really important for you , but it 's a great thing . It 's not a matter .
I 'm going to show you what I 'm doing now , because not as a UNK , because I don 't think so .
So , if you take a look at this slide from here , for example , I want to take a look at my face , and I want to get a look at the end of my life , and I want to get back to the end of the room , and I want to get back to the end of the room , and I want to get back to the end of the room , and I want to get back to the end of the room and say , " This is going on the end of a walk , " and a guy who 's coming up and down and down and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over , and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
This is what it looks like .
And I hope that doesn 't have a lot of fun than that .
I don 't know how that works .
The reality is , if you 've been doing a short time , you 've made a lot of work you 've done , but you 've heard a lot of work in the past 10 years , because there are a lot of work that might tell you about 10 years ago , and people are happy to see what you 're doing .
So the next thing that people do is , " What is going to happen ? "
Well , they 're going to do all of the photos , but that 's just a small part of the job .
And this is the first picture that I 've ever done with -- I don 't even have a month for my first time , and I don 't even have a month .
I know this is a bit of private people , but I 've got a lot of young .
This is a picture of me on my grandmother , a few months ago .
This is the picture of the picture .
And my friend did it with me .
This is a picture of me in the UNK UNK , who used to be photographed by the UNK UNK used in front of me .
This is my picture on my football team and magazine .
And this is where I am .
I want you to tell you that these are not my own pictures .
Instead , a group of UNK people , an architect , a researcher , a researcher , and a researcher , and then they made the idea that they made out of them , and it wasn 't what they made .
The next question is , " Can you get free ? "
I do not have too many of them , but for free , but for free , but that 's what I 'm really willing to talk about .
And I grew up in Cambridge City , and I went to a store and they sent me to my shirt .
And a few years later , I was walking to my friend , and she was a bad driver , and I said to me , " UNK , " he said , " I 'm going to go on the road . "
I 've got this because I 'm not alone , and I 'm a part of them , and some people think that they 're not the cost of my identity .
I lived in New York City , and I lived 18 , and a half of them were black , and most of them were young , and most of them were young .
And when you think about the United States in New York City in New York City , you know , the question is , " Am I going to stop ? "
" I 'm going to stop again ? How often do I get ? "
And I 've been talking about what I 've been doing about this year , 15 percent of the time in the United States in America who have seen a third child in 10 years old , and that 's about seven percent .
So the last question is , " How is it so ? "
I guess what they 're asking is , " Well , if you 're a little bit more than the next person , you 're going to have a click on your head , and you 're going to be very , very hard to believe . "
And at the end of time , we 're going to give you an example .
And we said , " Well , you know , there 's a great thing that 's going to work out of the past and the creative thing , and the people who work together are great . "
No , but half of the things that we 've never been told in the last week , I never said , " I 'm not secure . "
Because I 've got to worry about what I saw in my life .
If you think about it as if my big leg is better , it 's better . I 'm going to be more happy .
You just have to look at the model because they have the best legs of the most beautiful , and the most beautiful , and they 're probably the worst woman in the world , and they 're probably the most amazing woman in the world .
So when I talk about being able to do that , there 's a problem that 's really hard to do , because I 'm standing here , and I said , " Well , I don 't get any of the rest of my life if I 'm here today , and if you don 't get anything wrong in this room , and if it doesn 't work well if I 'm here , " Well , you know , I 've got a chance to do this in my life , " if I 'm here , I don 't have any sense of what 's going on with my life , " which doesn 't help me ? "
But the hardest part is that there 's a lot of people who are going to look at gender , because I have the most powerful benefit from my own life .
But in the same time , I 'm really excited about what I 've been doing , and what I 'm going to tell you about it is that there 's more than 10 or 30 years ago , and more than what they 're doing , and what I 'm going to tell you about is what I 'm going to tell you about what I 'm going to tell you about what I 'm going to tell you about what I 'm going to tell you about what I 'm going to tell you about what I 'm going to tell you about what I think is really important .
And if the computer can tell you what we can do , what we can do with the power that we all know , the power that we all know and what we understand and what we understand .
Thank you .
Today , I 'm going to ask one thing .
Don 't tell me it 's normal .
And I want to introduce you to my two brothers .
UNK is 25 years old .
He 's not talking about , but he can use music as well , and he 's going to have a place where he 's going to sleep .
UNK knows what is love .
He doesn 't enjoy his love that he doesn 't want to enjoy his love .
He doesn 't care ; it doesn 't matter what people are .
He did not say that religion is so bad , and he never said he never said he was right .
When he sang our son sang , I forgot a word that he was reminded , and he was reminded that we knew what we were about , and what was so special about us .
UNK is 16 years old , and it 's a lot .
He 's got a lot of memories .
But that memory is selection .
He didn 't remember the chocolate of my iPhone , and she was four years old , and when he was four years old , I was talking about the wrong moment of my arm in my hands , and there were all the time in my hands , and there were all the time in my hand , and there was a birthday on my arm in my hands , and he was on the day of UNK , and the UNK of UNK UNK in my hand .
Sound is so cool ?
But many people don 't think so .
And the thing is , because they don 't have a common sense of social change in common , they 're very popular and UNK .
But the thing I 'm sure is that even though you 're actually not being able to get people right now to tell people that they 're kind of familiar with autism , but it 's not true .
Some of you may not be able to know about this term , because of this , because it 's a complex brain , and it 's a complex brain disorder , and there 's a lot of activity in the brain that have sex with it .
Every patient is all special , and this is not the same thing .
And in the world , every 20 minutes , there is one of the most UNK of the world 's disease , but it 's one of the most of the time that the global disease is , but we don 't really know what it 's like to grow the virus and the treatment in the world .
I don 't know what I remember when I saw the word " disabled , " and I don 't even know what I 'm going to tell you about " cancer . "
When I was three , my brother was born , and I was very excited about when I was my new family .
And over a few months , I realized that he was different .
And he 's very , very famous .
He doesn 't want to be like other babies , and he 's like , and he 's like , and he 's kind of fun to me .
UNK UNK in his own world , and he 's looking for fun of all of the things that he 's looking for is going to look at the cell phone in the back of his cell phone , and he 's looking up to his shirt , and he 's looking for his cell phone , and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's looking up and he 's
And when he grew up , he 's getting more special than the special ones .
I mean , there are all sorts of other people who have sex and UNK and inevitable , and no matter what the world is , and it 's not that he 's in fact , " he 's going to be an invisible man in the world , and if he 's on the face of his life , " he 's not going to see the world that he doesn 't want to hear the world that he doesn 't want to hear about the world that he 's never heard of .
It 's not easy .
I can 't tell you how I think that 's true when I don 't think so much .
But I came back to what they teach me , what I tell them about sex , about sex and love , and what I don 't think about is " normal . "
" UNK " is something that is a great deal of the people who are so bad in the future of humanity .
It 's just to say , " You know , " right ? "
I just want to say a word that I just want to say to you , just to say that I 'm sorry that you 've got to be " normal . "
You can do it very well .
Whether it 's the difference that we 're all different from what we are all of our lives , and what we are all of our own life in our lives is that every single person has to have a chance to survive .
UNK and progress and change are human , and what we want to do is make a difference .
Please don 't tell me it . "
Thank you .
Edward UNK used this photo of UNK with our UNK and curiosity , and a thousand minutes ago .
But in the next 50 years , more than a million of us , we 're going to get faster than a million , a half of a second , but in a billion of the year or a half billion times , you can see the world around the world .
Now I 'm going to show you a new type of technology called an airplane that 's called UNK , and it 's too quick to get to capture the speed of light .
So with this technology , we can actually see a camera that doesn 't look at the surface of the fly , and if you look at the outside of the animal , you can see the surface of the camera , and we 're going to tell us about the camera of our body .
Now , if I do something a little bit more than a second or a half of a second -- you can do something a little bit , and a few of them -- just a couple of meters , and these lights are just a few meters , and it 's a little bit more than a light that you can see with light , and it 's just a few times faster than you can .
Now , if you take this piece of light , these light on the bottle , how can it take the bottles ?
What 's going on with the slow motion ?
Now , the whole thing -- that 's all right .
Now , please remember , this whole thing 's going to happen in a second time -- but it 's time to take a million times faster than you can see the movement .
But Coke is not going to help .
Now there are a lot of things going on here , so there 's a demonstration .
Right now , the light goes into the bottle , and we 're flying through the bottle , and the inside of the inside .
Some of the light comes out of the table , so you start to see these waves .
How many of the light can get into the glass and start to spread around the four weeks .
You can see , there 's a space bubble on there , and it 's on the horizon .
And the same time it 's on the table , and because the top of the top , you can see , in the top of the water , you can see the water behind the bottle , you can see , again , a few UNK later .
Now , if you look at the average traffic with average , same thing , as you can see , again , more than a million times , you know how long you 've got to see how long this time you need to see how to do this whole process ?
One day ? Actually , in fact , it 's a year .
It 's going to be very boring , very quickly .
But how do you look at them ?
You can see the UNK on the back of the table and the UNK and the wall .
This is like a rock in the water .
And I thought , that 's what the nature of nature , a UNK , a half a second , but of course we 're looking at the whole thing .
But if you look at the word in front of that red , you 're going to notice that when you 're looking at a UNK , it 's always going up . It 's not changed .
Why ? Because at the UNK , and light on a couple of years ago , the water comes from a second .
So , in the future , when you look at the camera , you can go from the cell , you can get to the supermarket , and you don 't even know what the water is .
So , how do I do with MIT in MIT ?
Now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to be careful , you just have a little closer , but we need less than a short time , but you don 't have to get anything .
So what we do is , we 're actually going to get these light into a few months , and all of these are going to be able to get out of these light , and then all of a sudden go up and down , and this is what you see .
And we made all of the data that 's going on , and it 's very interesting .
Now , a thousand people can fly .
Some of them were going to be invisible , but imagine a future of people , and he can see his face .
And this is the reason that we can get some of the lights into the door .
These lights go into the room , and you get back to the door , and you get to the camera , and we can use these light .
This is not science . We actually do it .
On the left-hand side you can see a UNK .
There is a personal model in the wall , and we 're going to fly .
So , in our case of course , it turns out that the Chinese Internet , and it 's based on its own Internet , and then they create this drawing .
And if you look at the sound of the box , and you 're going to get them to the wall , and you 're going to throw them up into the cell , and you 're looking at something that doesn 't look at all of us , but the most interesting thing is that it 's going to end up with a few of them , but the most interesting thing is that they 're going to get stuck in a different way .
And because we have an opportunity that 's so long enough , because we have a camera that 's going on , and we 're going to have something special power .
It 's a great time to see a lot of time , and you can get light out of light .
So again , we don 't only know the way that the camera 's going on , and we don 't even know what to do , but we don 't know what the point is .
By the way , what we 're looking at is , and what we 're going to do is , and what we 're seeing here is what 's going on on the screen , and as you can see , a lot of stuff , a lot of stuff , and a lot of them , and then we can see the invisible object on the surface , and now we can see the invisible object there , and then we can see the invisible object there ?
Can we imagine that ?
This is our model .
Now we 're going to be able to get into a living room , and if you look at the corner , but you can see them in the window , because you can see them in the window , or if you look at the outside of the window , and you can see the inside of the inside , you can see the inside of the inside , you can see the inside of the inside , you can see the inside of the body , and we can even look at the heart of the body .
But of course , since all of the organizations and the blood vessels of all of our organizations , they 're really hard to figure out how to look at the world as a new model of being solved , to actually think of that as a way of a health problem .
Now , as a scientist , as a scientist , and I realize that a lot more than what we 're seeing , and what we 're seeing is that the thing that we 've collected in common is that there 's a lot of data , and there 's a lot of data , and a lot of them , and a lot of them , a little bit of what we see , and what we 're seeing , and what we 're seeing is that the number of things come out of time , and a lot of them , a little bit of time , a little bit of a little bit of what we 're seeing and what we 're seeing , and what we 're seeing is that the technology is now and a little bit of a little bit , and a little bit of the technology that we 're seeing , and we 're seeing a little bit of time ago , and a lot of them , a little bit , a little bit of an UNK , a little bit more than a little bit of what we 're seeing
But there are some interesting things happening .
When you see the UNK on these UNK , they 're leaving us .
But these UNK should be moving .
What happened ?
And the result is , because we 're closer to record this stuff , we have some strange phenomenon , and as you can see , in fact , they 're really happy to see these images .
And the thing that happens is that when you get into a camera , you get stuck at the same time with the space , and we can fix it .
So what we 're looking at is , if you look at the thing , the idea of the design , and what we want to do is to make a difference between us , and what we 're going to do is , and what we 're going to do is , and what we 're going to do is , and what we 're going to do is we 've all made out of our data , and what we 're going to do is we don 't think of all of the things that we shouldn 't do , and we 're going to tell you a little bit more about what we 're doing , and what we 're going to do is , and what we 're going to do is , and what we 're going to do is we 've all made out of the idea that we should not be able to use the tools that we shouldn 't do , and we 're going to tell us that we shouldn 't have something that 's more important than what we should do , and what we 're actually going to do
Not so much . Thank you .
This is the place where I live , and Kenya is the South Bronx in Florida .
When I was my father in my father 's grandmother 's grandmother 's in my father 's house , they were all over his country .
The South Bronx in the West Bank , which means " UNK " like " UNK " that can move itself from the park .
So the fishermen are going to tell them , and that 's what they 're doing .
They killed us all .
And this is the guy who 's pregnant in the night , and when I wake up in the morning , I realized that he 'd been killed by a while , because this is my only child in my home .
We believe that our UNK believe that we are , and we are eating our animals and homes from the heavens , and from the home , and this is why we tell them about how we feel .
So I became very tired of UNK .
And the thing is , people are UNK , protecting our families and livestock , but they are so frustrated that the problem is so frustrated and so on .
So they decided to kill these lions .
This is one of them in the UNK UNK in UNK .
And this is why I think that this is an example of what is happening in the Galapagos .
At our home , we were all four of the boys who were all going to protect their mother 's responsibility , and all the same thing happened in my life .
So I 've got to get a solution to that .
And the first thing that I wanted to use fire , because I knew that lions were afraid of fire .
But then I realized that this is not something that didn 't work , and it 's going to help lions see lions lions .
But I 'm not even doing it . I 'm tired and I 'm not going to do it .
So , there are the second solution : the UNK .
I wanted to UNK the lion , and I was standing on the UNK .
But lions are smart .
And they saw a few days ago , and they went back , and they said to them , but the next day , they 're all over the place , and he 's waiting for this thing .
So they kept up , and they killed animals .
And one night , I took the phone in the milk , and there he died on the night , and it wasn 't there .
And I started to realize that lions are going to hurt .
So I had a little idea about it .
Because when I was a kid , I could not do anything else in my house , and when I was in my house , I could not get my mother out of my mother , and that 's what I 've learned about what I 've learned about what I 've learned .
So I found a hot car , a UNK . This is a little device that you find out of a UNK car , you find a light bulb , you can get a light bulb .
And at the same time I found a switch on , you could control the lights .
The light bulb comes from a bad hand .
It 's all ready .
And as you can see , because you can see the solar cell phone battery , you have electricity , you 've got to give the power to make a sense of what I call " UNK . "
So this is a flash of light .
As you can see , the electron bubble on the outside , because lions comes from there .
And that 's what it looks like in the UNK .
And the lights are going to get back to the people who have lions , and they can walk around in front of the time , but actually , at the time , at the time , actually , at the time , actually I 've ever done my bed in my bed right now , so I 'm sitting on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to do a break on my bed , and actually I 'm going to
Thank you .
And I 've taken this device in two years , and then we don 't have lions UNK anymore .
My neighbors all heard this .
One of them is this guy .
And she 's a whole bunch of UNK in the UNK , and she asked me if she could do this in my home .
I love it .
And I put these lights up , and you can see them in the back , these are the UNK .
So far , I 've been told that we 've got the number of seven of our families on our families , and they 're very useful .
Now , what I 've been doing is that all of them have used to be able to get rid of all of the food that we 've been using for the whole time , like UNK dogs , as they used to use all of the animals that have been used as far as they used to get out of the food as they used to get away from around us .
And I was very lucky because this was the invention of the program , and this is the greatest school in Kenya , and I 've been so proud to that .
My new schools are now joined , and I 'm going to help you get better and raise more money .
And I even asked my friends to my community , and help them have no matter of what I teach them , how I teach them .
And a year ago , I was a hot guy who helped me , and I looked at the UNK , and I always looked at the airplane , and tell me , " There is a day , and I 'm going to get there .
And today , I did it .
And I received an opportunity to fly , and this is my first time .
So my great idea is that when I grew up , I was a flying engineer .
And I 'm talking about lions , but now because of my dad saving my father 's wife and lions lions , and we can get lions and peace everywhere .
Thank you so much .
UNK UNK : You don 't believe , listen to how the story works .
So you 've got this reward . UNK UNK : Yes .
Are you just going to get another one ?
What 's going to your next step ?
UNK : My next project is , I wanted to do a UNK . UNK ?
DH : You know , the power is already there , but I just want to do my own .
You 've been trying to do it again , but -- you know , at the moment , I said , " Well , I 've got a problem , but I 've stopped it , because it 's too slow to me .
DH : It 's a failure . UNK UNK , you 're different .
We 're going to be able to get into something that 's going to be around in a long way , a friend .
Thank you . UNK .
I lived in L.A. .
This is Los Angeles : UNK restaurants , UNK . UNK land .
So the city of the city , they 're talking about the name of the name of the South Bronx , so you know , if you look at the name of the South Bronx , and if you look at the city of the city , it looks like this today 's going to solve a real question about what the city 's supposed to be like .
This is South Carolina .
UNK , UNK restaurants , UNK land .
There are two million American people living in food , and I live in a food called UNK , who don 't need to be able to drive food , they don 't need to be able to get out of the parking lot .
And the interesting thing about it is that it 's more time than it is to kill .
In Los Angeles , people were dying .
For example , my food rate in less than the United States in my neighborhood are more than 80 times higher than 80 feet higher than eight miles in the United States , and maybe 80 times more than eight times .
I hate that reality .
And at the same time , if there is no way to get into health food , what do you get out of the food system that you 've seen in your community today , what do you think of it ?
And I saw the wheel to buy cars like two cars .
I see how I see the idea of the star as there is as well as it is to me .
I don 't think that 's going to go .
I think the answer is already there .
Food is the problem , food is the solution .
And again , I 'm tired of all the five minutes to go to the next 10 minutes , and to buy the Apple .
So what I did was I was in my house , and I was in my house .
This is what we call the banking path .
It 's 15 feet long .
UNK governments are all there .
But it needs someone to protect it .
So I thought , " Great ! This is my responsibility . I have to protect it . I 've got to do what I want to do . "
This is why I am protecting it .
So my team , " UNK , " and we 're starting to grow up the food forest in the trees , and there 's a whole lot of food in the trees .
We are a free organization , because we don 't have the same community in the world , and all of them are all volunteers , and all of all of us are services that we do all of our jobs .
UNK are beautiful .
But it 's pretty fast .
The government said me , giving me a message to get me to get rid of my garden , and then I could get a warning .
And I thought , " Why ?
There is no point on the other side of food that 's not really concerned about food on a small piece of food on the side of the tree .
And then I thought , " Well , that 's so cool . "
Because it doesn 't happen .
So , when it comes to his grandfather , they wrote a little bit about their story , and they signed a lot of people , and they 're going to get to the book , and they 're going to spread to the website , and we succeeded .
We use our hands to succeed .
And he said , " Well , there is a lot of love and love love for what we do . "
I mean , of course , how can they not do that ?
This is an area on the United States of Mexico .
It 's got 200 square kilometers .
And this is a map of 2009 .
There are enough spaces to grow up to 100 million of them .
Why did they feel so bad ?
A tree can harvest a thousand , and maybe more than one .
A dollar of green can be brought to seven dollars per single .
And this is my faith , and I 'm telling you a food that 's going on in my own food .
The food is better than what you see if it 's food .
So , you know , I 've got a legacy in Los Angeles .
I grew up there , and I grew up there .
I refuse to be part of what I 've been able to do with my own reality that I 'm going to create .
Come on , I 'm a artist .
UNK is my UNK , and I create my own art .
And as you can see , you know , they 're kind of like UNK and they 're all in the wall , and me , UNK , UNK .
I took the garden and the UNK and the trees and the trees that I built on the painting .
You can do what you can do about it , if you take a map out of your canvas .
You can 't imagine how amazing it can be , and it will affect what it means to be .
What 's going to happen ?
And I saw my whole garden into education , and became a tool for my community .
To change the community , you have to change the soil .
We are soil .
You 'll be surprised by kids .
UNK is the most benefit of our personal health and challenging lives , especially in the center of the city .
And again , you can harvest the grass .
And I remember once a mother and daughter in 10 and a half minutes later , and when I showed up , I was looking at them , and I was looking at them , and they were kind of hard to think of them .
They made me feel very bad , and I tell them , and you don 't like to eat food .
This is the UNK in the street .
When I saw people on my side , I saw a lot of people who were hungry , and people said to me , " That 's , you 're afraid , you 're afraid of why people don 't hurt you ? "
And I said , " Well , of course , of course , I 'm not afraid of that .
And this is why it 's on the street .
And this is what I want .
I want people to walk away , but I want to be able to get health care of health . "
And one time I was in the center of a UNK in Los Angeles , there was a garden park .
These little guys were helping me get paid .
And this is really cool , and they share with what they 're doing , and what they 're going to do with their mother and their grandmother , and how they think they 're really cool , just think about this moment , just for the moment that they are .
Green organizations also start out of UNK as 20 garden .
We 've got about 50 people involved in our team , and they 're all volunteers .
If kids don 't have UNK , the kids will eat UNK .
And if they were growing up , they would eat UNK .
But people who don 't have children , if they don 't have food , and if they don 't get food or body , they just don 't care about what they 're doing .
I saw young people trying to work , but they 're all fun , but they 're all over the course , and they 're all part of the way that they 're trying to work , and that 's not what they 're doing .
When it 's time to travel , I found a chance that we could train these kids to take care of their communities , and they could grow up in a sustainable way .
When we do it we do , who knows what we are .
UNK to the next dog .
But if we don 't change the soil , we never did it again .
This is one of my plans . This is what I wanted to do .
I want a whole street in the street where people can share food on this street .
I wanted to create the UNK with health .
Don 't get it wrong .
I 'm not thinking about free because I 'm not sustainable .
It 's very important for what you need to be doing .
And what I 'm talking about is that people who get jobs , and they 're going to understand what they 're doing , and they 've gotten their own food in the food , and it 's called " The UNK , " and open the farmers ' market . "
So what I 'd like to do is to think more about the future of this project .
I want to ask what we 're going to be the environment for our environment , for example , with UNK .
And we 're going to change what 's going on .
If you 're not a park , you 're not a UNK .
What do you do when you take a UNK ?
Let 's take a dish that you choose .
And basically , if you want to see me , if you want to touch it , if you 're going to get a bad chair , you 're going to tell me a little bit about it .
And if you think about it , I 'm going to do this in front of the subway , and then we can do something about it .
UNK . Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you .
When I was a photographer , I was an UNK , and a lot of New York City in New York City .
We don 't have sex . We 've lived on death .
We were all over the room , and there 's a dark room in the room , and there 's a room called UNK , where they don 't have the window , the main rooms in the room , and the main thing is to get to the sun .
And we 're going to be able to get the perfect shape out of the fact that we 're going to be able to get the perfect muscle , and if we don 't have any media , but we 've always seen what 's going on , but we 've always seen what 's going on , but we 've always seen an artist 's life , and we 're going to understand what 's going on with the fact that we 've been able to do what we 've been doing .
In 2001 , a half of the world on the planet , and they 're all over the world , and I can see the Japanese in Japan .
And after a while , I 'm a group of volunteers , and I 'm a member of volunteers , and I 'm just going to get stuck in the morning , just in a few days , at the time that we need to develop an ambulance in the ground .
And I and others know , I can 't tell you that we shouldn 't get out of the house because we shouldn 't add their list , and they 're going to be able to save lives in three weeks ' time .
It 's five months old days , and I came to Japan today .
This is a UNK village in Japan , and there are about 50,000 people , and of course the first wave of disaster .
At the end of the time that the peak of the earthquake in the peak of the peak of the peak of the peak in the peak of the peak of the peak , 40 meters attacks , there 's 20 miles away from the ground .
You can imagine , this town must be saved .
We set the UNK of the UNK and the water .
We 're going to help schools and those people who don 't look at the house , clear , easy , UNK .
And we understood a lot of UNK , the UNK of the UNK , the fish that were designed in the factory , all over the local factories .
We 're all going to get a dirty smell , but we 're good at it .
And a few weeks later , there are all volunteers and local people who are looking at something like something .
They don 't always find photos of photos , but they have cameras and UNK and UNK .
And everybody 's going to be able to act with it as well .
They take all of these pictures and put them together and put them into the town .
Now , until now , I realized that the photo of these guys must have been a big part of those people .
When they were attacked by the tsunami they were thinking , you know , there 's all four things , and all of them need to get out of a room , looking at a cell phone , and for all of them , and for all of them , all of the things that are all out of it , they 're all over the back of the room , and they 're all over the back of the room .
And a few days later on my day , I found myself in the center of the town .
Help the UNK UNK in the New York .
You know , it 's good at the moment where people are losing people .
People were getting hundreds of photos of that one , and at the time that I was so happy to get their trust , let me start with a photograph , and some pictures .
And those moments were truly exciting , and I 'm just listening to people who said , " You know , you need to get creative , and you can tell what I really do . "
And when I look at these pictures , I don 't even have the idea that I 've been able to identify some of them , and perhaps in the developing world , but also some of the people who are able to fix them , and I can tell them to help you get these pictures of them .
So at night , I left a whole bunch of UNK friends in the morning , and not a lot of information on the morning , and do I know what we should be doing .
So we began to fix the map .
This is a photograph that actually tried .
It 's not so severe , but the water in the water that he 's got in the face of his hand , but the water doesn 't get into the face of the book , and we have to become a very good idea of what 's going on .
Otherwise , little girls don 't look up at the face of her face , and that 's so big , and so on .
And as soon as a result , as we 've been able to do more of these pictures , I 've got to get them to help to help these photos , and I 've been able to do more architects , and I 've got to get them to help to help these images , and then there 's a lot of people who are going to help them to help , and they 're going to be able to help with them , and they 're going to be able to help with them , and they 're going to be able to help to help out of school , and they 're going to be able to help with them , and they 're going to be able to help to help out of school , and they 're going to be able to help with them , and they 're going to be able to help to help out of school , and they 're going to be able to help with them , and they 're going to be able to help with their community , and they 're going to be able to help
And in two weeks , I got an answer to the question of 10 volunteers , and they were willing to join us .
At the age of July , only in Japan , we have a lot of people who have spent a lot of time in the middle of the city , and on the north UNK .
And every week , we 're all in the center of the museum in the center of the room , and people come back to see their pictures .
And sometimes , a few years later , people who have lost their body , get rid of them , and they might be able to get out of the planet , and if they 're going to be able to get out of the planet , and they 're going to be able to get out of the fact that they 're going to be able to get out of the fact that they 're going to be able to get out of the fact that they 're going to be able to get out of the fact that they 're going to be able to get out of the fact that they 're going to be able to get out of the fact that they 're going to be able to get out of the fact that they 're going to be able to get out of the planet , and if they 're going to be able to get out of the planet , and they 're going to be able to get out of the fact that they 're going to be able to get out of the fact that they 're going to be able
And yet , at the time , they got to go back to these photos , and then they were all going to get out , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course ,
And you might get it out , and maybe it 's going to be able to grow a few weeks .
And then there 's a couple of months .
And the beautiful and the UNK of the photograph are going to be able to work out of hand , or a little bit of color , and one of the colors that don 't have to do anything that don 't have to be able to get into the water that 's going on in the bad place in the face of the water that doesn 't have to be able to do so well .
The whole process is very expensive .
So all of these UNK are UNK into the water , and at the water level , and at the water , and at the same time , at the time it 's in the water , it 's time to get rid of the water , and there 's a lot of water that 's all over the place , and there 's a lot of money to get out of this project , and there 's a lot of money to get out of this project , and there 's a whole part of the project that 's being made of this project .
And if these pictures don 't get clean , we can 't start to fix it yet , and we don 't have to fix them yet , but they 've got to do all the time .
Our hands on the hand are very , very well .
There is a woman where there is a woman who says that we can do it .
These are just so easy to lose .
As my team , he said , this is like a human being in human beings .
You don 't have anything that 's going on , and it 's going to be bad .
And that gives us the pictures of these photographs , and these are all these pictures .
She also began to photograph her hand , until she realized that she was able to get out of the fact that she could make a lot of damage .
And it 's great to have a photograph .
Otherwise , in the picture , she and her face were completely different than all of them , and so we could get all of the parts to all of them , and then we built this picture .
When she came to the photo of the photo , she told us to share some pictures back .
And the pictures that he 's found out of her husband 's found on the ground side of the ground , which is not so far away from the ground , where they 've seen this place .
At the end of the ocean , he 's in the right place to make sure that the water is going to shut up .
And when the police were affected , he had to stop the end of the sea .
She 's got two sons , and it 's too small , and there 's a couple of different schools in two different schools schools .
And one of the kids in the schools are caught up .
She spent a whole week , and as soon as he died , they were dead .
And we gave her her picture , and it was the UNK of a child who was four years old .
And for her to tell her , I could tell you that a little bit of UNK in the rest of his son would give his son a few days ago , and there 'd be a few months ago that he 's going to be able to get out of the rest of his life , and if he 's in his son , he 's going to change his life , or not get his way out of the fact that he 's been destroyed by the fact that he 's going to change his life in his life , and if it 's all happened , or something that 's going on in his life , or it might be destroyed by the fact that he 's been able to change the way that he 's going to change his life , or not .
After six months in Japan , there 's a million people who are going to be able to get out of UNK in Japan , and more of them are going to be able to get out of a UNK UNK , a few of them .
Most of them ended up in the blind hand , and it 's important .
Today , 500 volunteers have helped us to go back to 90 percent of their homes , these pictures are UNK .
In the course of this time , we don 't have the equipment or materials , and most of them are made out of UNK ink .
And we were very close to that .
So , a picture of a vision and a point to remind us , a little bit of people , a little bit of work , a little bit of people .
They 're helping us record and save our lives and our lives in the moment of our time is a very difficult moment for us to ignore , but at the end of the day , and we first wanted to get back to it .
And this is all part of the program , because of the UNK in the human community , and people who interact with them .
As a result of this photo , it 's going to be huge , and it 's going to be very different from the idea of the loss of life .
And that 's because we 've made a huge change in our own structures .
For a few of these , many of these , many of these things come out to be part of what they 're doing , and what they 're doing is they 're all over the communities , and they 're going to do more of what they want , and what they 're doing , and what they 're doing is , what they 're doing , and what they 're doing is , what they 're doing , and they 're going to be able to do what they can build , and what they can do with them , not only to use the model , but to have the UNK you 've ever done .
I 'd like to tell you about what I 'm going to tell you about my email email , and I collect a week , and I got six and a half months later , and I went home from the Japanese home to my day .
" When I was trying to replicate , I don 't want to get all of those people who are going to spread through them .
And in fact , a woman who 's been a young woman , and a little girl , and a few years ago , a little girl , and my grandmother and me , in the wall , in my grandmother , who 's in the wall of my life , and this photo is in my house , and it 's in my house , and it 's in my house , and it 's in my house .
There 's a global world , and there 's more of the age of global growth , and we have a few basic need to become a UNK , and do you ? "
Thank you very much .
Today , I want to talk a little bit about the question , and the answer to that question .
And I 'm going to tell you about a secret , and I 'm going to ask the question , " Why am I ? "
" How do you have a man who 's going to continue with a man who 's going to continue ? "
I 'm not a psychopath ; society community , but not the experts in the family .
I 'm just a woman who has a conversation .
When I was 22 , I was just born from Harvard .
I moved to New York City , and I started working on my first job , and she started working with a magazine called UNK .
I had a house with my house , and I was a very big secret .
And the secret is that I think that my soul and my partner , I think that I 'm a guy in my soul , and I think that 's too much fun to my wife , too many times , too much .
And one of the most people I 've taken , and I 've taken the gun , and I 'm afraid to kill me , and I 'm not going to remember how many times I 've ever done before .
Now , what I 'm talking about is this crazy story of what I 'm talking about is that there 's a lot of life with love sex , and there are millions of women who are all over the place of sex , and there are even some of these men who are going to get rid of this kind of stuff .
Maybe it 's happening in your body .
I don 't see if I don 't have sex with the typical family .
I 've got a English professor of Harvard , and I 've got a UNK degree in UNK , California .
I 'm trying to spend a lot of time thinking about 50 UNK jobs , including health and Washington .
I married my second husband , and there are three kids who are going to have three of them .
I was a black party with a black party with a UNK UNK .
And that 's what I 'm going to tell you about , and what 's going to happen in the family that 's going on in every single person in every single person , you know , confidence , income , income , income , education .
It 's everywhere .
And the second thing that I 'm going to tell about is that many of us think that there are more people on women 's lives than women 's lives .
No .
More than eight percent of the people who have sex in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the way , in the family , in the family , in the way , in the family , in the family , in the way , in the family , in the family , in the way , in the family , in the way , in the family , in the family , in the way , in the family , in the way , in the way , in the family , in the family , in the way , in the way , in the family , in the home , that 's why it 's so , and that 's why the family 's disease is so important .
And I thought that one in the world is there , and I 'm sure that I 'm going to stay in a man 's side , but actually in my age this year , it 's very , very common .
When I was 22 years old , I was older than girls in the United States , and over the course of the year , and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the other year
I 'm a very , very special victim , because of my family violence and development .
And I met myself in a UNK , and it 's a month and it 's cold .
We were sitting in New York in New York , and he said to me .
And he told me two things .
And the first thing he did is he graduated from San Francisco school , and was working on a very nice Wall Street .
But the first time that I 'm going to leave you with my vision is his vision and humor , and he looks like a farm .
His face was like a UNK UNK , and it seemed like a lot of people like it .
And the most of the most exciting thing about ever been able to do what I think of that is that I 'm a very strong part of this feeling .
When I first started , he was like me to tell him that he was on his way .
And we started talking , and he was like me , and he was like , and my smart , who I was in Harvard , and I was giving me a lot of women 's violence , and I was working with my job in Harvard .
He really wanted to know my family , my childhood , my wish and my dreams .
UNK for me is a woman , a woman and a woman , and there are never even before others .
He never knew a little bit on his body , and he said to me that he 'd never been told he was going to get out of his life , and he said to me that he 'd never been able to do something very sick in the age of his life , and he said to me that he 'd never been able to get his fortune back into his life , and he took a lot of time to build his life he could build his life back in his 20s , and he took a lot of time to rebuild his life in about 20 years .
And that 's why the UNK of the University , the UNK and the UNK , the future of the light , the vision of his mind .
What if there were people to tell me that I could tell you about what I 'm doing , what I 'm doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , where I 've been able to make a sense of what I 'm doing , what I 'm doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , what I 've been doing , where I 've been able to
And when I didn 't even know , UNK and UNK were the first step in the family 's relationship .
And I didn 't even know what the second thing is that there were victims of the victims .
And I 'm sorry about the fact that I 'm going to leave you from the end of my life , and I 'm going to tell you what I 'm going to tell you about , my family , and I 'm going to tell you what I 'm going to tell you about , and my family , and I 'm going to tell you where I 'm going to tell you what I 'm going to tell you about , and my family , and I 'm going to leave you to you , and I 'm going to tell you where I 'm here , and I 'm going to tell you where I 'm here , and I 'm going to tell you where I 'm here , and I 'm going to tell you where I 'm here , and I 'm going to tell you where I 'm here , and I 'm going to tell you where I 'm here , and I 'm going to tell you where I 'm going to leave you , and I 'm going to tell you where I 'm going to tell you that my
The thing is , of course , when he comes from a week , he 's not going to be able to get out of his job , and he said to me , " Well he 's going to help me get out of his job , and he 's going to help me get out of his job , and he 's going to get to know he 's going to get away from his job , and he 's going to get his good job , and he 's going to get the guy who 's going on , and he 's going to get into his job , and he 's going to get the guy who 's going on , and he 's going to get me to the next town , and he 's going to get the guy who 's going on , and he 's going to get the guy who 's going on , and he 's going to get out of his life , and he 's going to get out of his life , and he 's going to get out of his life , and he 's going
And at the time , what I didn 't want to do was to get out of New York , but for a good job , but I think I need to get out of my love , but I think , " Oh , " I 'm sorry , " I 'm sorry , " and I said , " I 'm sorry , " I 'm sorry , " and " I said , " I 'm sorry . "
I got a crazy love for myself , and I don 't even know what I 've been doing , and I 've never been able to understand how I 've been able to get a sense of where you feel , where you get into your body , heart , heart and economic chaos .
And the third stage of the family model doesn 't start to use violence .
And this is the gun that came out .
And we moved to New England -- I thought , " I wanted it to be a very safe gun -- and he bought three guns .
UNK in the garage box .
For a bed in bed , there 's a third party in the pocket .
And he said , " Well , he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he
She 's going to make him secure .
And the gun said to me , " Well , if he doesn 't have a clear signal , if he doesn 't have a UNK gun , I 've got no time in the risk of danger .
When I was 15 days ago , I was on my wedding .
And it 's four years old , and I 'm wearing sleeping .
I 'm working on a computer , and I have a lot of my anger , and at the time , I have some kind of my anger , who 's going to get out of the job , and I 've got no idea of my neck , and if he comes from my neck , who 's going to get me in the back of my neck ?
And five days later , the 10 fingers on the back of the UNK , and I was on my mom 's wedding , and he 's giving him back to his mom 's wedding .
But despite all of those things , I 'm sure that we can be happy because of our time because we 're so cute .
He said that very profound sense .
He 's just the pressure . It 's too strong . It 's time to get me back to him because he 's coming up and he 's coming down .
This is an accident , and he 's not going to hurt me .
It 's two times a year ago .
And first time , I was trying to look at the UNK of UNK , and I was able to get away from my head to stop the glass in my head .
But a few days later , he was driving his way to the road home , and he was going up , and he 's going to have a cold cold , and he 'd kind of had a cold cold ice in my face .
I 'm going to get two years in my life in New York City , and every week in my life .
I 've been so privileged to have someone who had this one .
In fact , a third American woman who had a home violence in the family of the family and the potential , and the UNK report in every year , and a half of them were saving , and about 150 million children .
So in fact , I 'm not an example .
Last question : why do I get there ?
And the answer to that is easy .
I didn 't know he was saving me .
And even though I put his hand on the back of my hand , and I put my dog back up at the very same time , I would not get my dog from my hands , and I never thought I 'd never be able to get my hands on the back of my head , and I never thought I 'd never thought of myself an old wife .
Instead , I 'm a very hard woman and I love a lot of people , and I 'm the only person to get to help with my own mind .
And the other question I want to ask is , why don 't she leave away ?
Why not ? I don 't get away . I 've got a lot of opportunity .
For me , this is the most powerful thing that I 've asked , and what I 've asked you to do , but only what we do know , but only if we 're afraid of our victims , but only our victims .
Because the last step in the home room is killing her .
And over 70 percent of all of our families were killed by the victims of the victim , and after she left away , because UNK have been UNK .
And the other thing that he could do at the end of my life , even from the UNK of the UNK , the UNK of the family , and she 's going to be able to get back to the problem of the family , and she 's going to have a problem with a family , and she 's going to have a guy who 's going to be able to have a problem with a woman who 's going up with a lot of time ago .
Now we still ask , why did she get away from it ?
And I decided to leave by the end of the last time I decided that I could get away the limits .
I realized that if I 'm not going to fight this guy , this woman who 's going to kill me .
So I made a silence .
And I asked people to ask : police , neighbors , my friends and family , and I 'm here to be here , because you 've got to help me .
We tend to take the victims of the victims , and we use it as a UNK woman , as a matter of a smell .
" Why is she going ? " asked this question .
Some of them were actually saying , " This is her face , and it 's like a victim is to have sex with the people who don 't care .
But , in fact , a lot of people who were told they were going to tell people about what they were doing , and what they did was they were looking at what they were doing , and what they were trying to tell about what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing , and what they were doing
In fact , I 'm a typical family , and I 'm a typical family survivor .
And I said to myself again with a hot man , and I have three kids .
I was a black party with a black party with a UNK UNK .
And I never got it . I 've never got this forever , but I 've never done my hand on my hand and say I 've got my hands on my head .
And at the time , you 're thinking , well , this is so amazing , or , " Oh , but at the end of the process , I 'm talking about what you 're talking about .
And I 'm sure , you know , some people who are in the audience now have someone in the audience who have been suffering from a while , and you 're a UNK .
You can get a woman who 's going to happen in your daughter , who 's going on your sister and your best friends in your life .
I can tell you the story of " The UNK of " the UNK of UNK " of UNK .
And today I 'm going to break down the silence .
And this is what I helped people with the victims , but also me , by the end of you .
Tell someone to you hear this today .
It 's like you to live in a silence .
You have the ability to get rid of the violence just to light up the moon .
We need a victim to every one of us .
We need every one of your understanding of family violence .
And your kids , your colleagues , your friends and family talking about the word , and the people who are going to talk about them .
Help happiness come back and get a good look at the best , but they 're really happy us , but they 're going to have the future .
And there 's the potential to find out the health of the family 's ability to identify what 's going to happen , and it 's going to be safe to the victims of the victims .
So let 's take a hand back and ask our bed , and we 're waiting for them to be secure , and we have all kinds of security , peace .
Thank you .
When I was a child , I think my country is the best part of the world , and I 've learned a word called " The UNK . "
I felt so proud .
In school , we don 't have any time to learn the history of health , but we 've never seen any of the world 's problems since the United States and Japan and Japan on the planet .
Although I am very close to the outside of the world , and I 've always changed since I was there , and I 've always changed since I was there .
When I was seven years old , I saw a great job , but I think I 'm very good at the time .
My family is not poor . And I said , I never experienced an awful feeling .
But when I was 15 years old , my mom brought a letter home from her from her father .
And it says , " When you 're reading this letter , my family is going to leave everybody in the world , because we 've all got something else in two weeks .
And we 're lying on the floor , and our bodies are all UNK , and ready to die . "
And I was so surprised .
That 's the first time that I 've heard a lot about my country in my country today .
And after that , I was walking around a train station , and I saw a very sad thing that I saw nothing so hard to forget .
A bad woman in the room is lying on the ground , and it 's like a UNK child , and the child is just going to wake up his mother 's face .
But nobody 's helping them because of all of you who don 't want to do anything .
There were a big hunger in the late ' 90s .
But unfortunately , more than a million of them die in the hunger and most of them are dependent on food , worms and trees .
It 's as if it 's a little bit , and there 's a whole bunch of paper on the night , and there 's a lot of money out of the room , except for the rest of the world , except for the end of my house .
I was thinking about why they were so hot .
This is a satellite map , and photographed the night and the rest of the world .
This is " UNK , " which is the part of the Chinese and the UNK .
And as you can see , this river is very useful in some places that can be used to the United States .
But a lot of people 's going to die .
Sometimes I saw the body in the water .
I 'm not going to be able to tell too much about the rest of the time , but I just say that 's the most difficult years of my life , and I was sent to China and UNK .
And I thought that I was a short time to share with my family .
But I never thought I was going to get older years ago .
In China , as a child , I 've been very sick as a child girl .
I don 't know , because I 'm going to see what life I 've been doing to live , but I 'd be very happy to realize that life is going to be dangerous , but not so dangerous , because of the people in the Chinese , because of the people who don 't think of it as dangerous as they are .
So I 'm always living in fear , and I 'm afraid of my identity , and I 'm going to send back and get scared about fear .
And one day , my worst of my worst nightmare is , and I was in the Chinese police and brought the police to the police .
There are people looking out of what I 'm doing , and what I 'm looking for is trying to work on my own language , and ask me a lot of questions .
And I was very scared , and I felt so sad .
If there is any other way , I 'm going to get back to jail and get sent away .
I 've done this for my life . I 've tried to hide the fear of our fears and their fears , and tell their questions .
And after that , there was a police say that he said , " UNK is wrong .
She 's not looking at the people . "
And then they took me . It was a miracle .
Some of the people in China were looking at the UNK , but a lot of people were arrested by the Chinese police and were sent to return to North Korea .
These girls are lucky .
And even though they were caught up , but they were very important in the most of them , where they were released .
But some people don 't have that much longer .
Every year , less than 90 percent of the Chinese have been sent down to the United States , and they 're locked up , or whatever they are .
But even though I was able to get lucky enough to get away from the side of my life , I 'd not have so good luck .
And this is a very sad fact , and that 's where people must not be able to hide the name because the effort is only to survive .
Even if they learn Chinese , find jobs , and their whole world is going to be on the edge .
And this is why in the UNK , I decided to take the Queen of Korea , and again , I started a new life .
I was more difficult than what I was thinking about , and it 's more difficult than what I was thinking about .
English is so important in the West , so I have to start to learn a third word for English .
In addition , I realized that there was a huge difference between Korea and North Korea .
Even though we are all UNK , but we are very different from the age of UNK .
I even experienced my identity of identity .
How did I tell people in Korea ?
Where am I ? Who am I ?
And suddenly I was as if I was a country called my own country .
And even though the war is not good , it 's not easy , but I also decided to do it .
UNK to learn .
And when I first started to use a long time , I got an incredible call .
There were a lot of money out of my home , and I 'm going to take care of my family , and my family 's going to get to where I 'm going to move into a remote place in the rural village .
They need to get away from it , so I start to try and help them out .
UNK often don 't have so far away from their own path .
I want to look at the opposite of the West and the West and the rest of the West and say , " You know , I don 't have a chance to fly , and I 'll just fly into the Chinese and go and go to the Middle East . "
Because my family doesn 't understand Chinese , so I 've got to help them in China to 2,000 kilometers into the Middle East .
We 've got a week on the UNK side of a week , and a couple of them were caught up .
And again , we sat down , and we sat down , and one of the Chinese police came in .
And he looked at everybody 's attention , and he 's going to ask questions .
Because my family doesn 't understand the Chinese , and I 'm afraid they would be caught .
So when the Chinese police came to visit me , where I could stand up with my family , I could tell you about this little bit of UNK people , and I 'm a nurse .
And he said to me , but luckily , he believed that .
And that 's how we get older , but I 'm going to spread all over the rest of all the time to the UNK .
And even if we do that , my family is in the West , and he 's being arrested .
When I joined the money and the UNK , and my family gave up , and not too long later , and after the old age , they were caught up .
That is one of the poorest moments in my life .
I 've made my people to get free , and as long as I 'm going to get sick , everyone else 's going to get out of the long time , and then people who are going to get old , and where this is going to be a long time ago .
And I went back to the civil society and the police to return , and to try to get away from help , but I never had enough money to pay for money , but also for money .
And I was shocked .
And at the time , I heard a guy asked me , " How ? "
I 'm a UNK . I have a whole stranger .
I 've taken away from my UNK English , and I don 't think that person 's going on , and I 'm going to tell you why I 'm going to go to my family , and my family and all the rest of the rest are all available .
And I thank you so much , and he said , " Why are you going to help me ? "
" I 'm not helping you , " he said .
" I 'm helping people . "
And I realized that that 's the moment that my life is about a moment .
I think that a great question is what people like me and what most people want to do with me , and he gives me a good idea of what people want to live , and what the international society are , of course , are the ones that we need .
And eventually , at the end of a long time , I had a very long time with my family , and my family died for a half of war .
A lot of people and their families get away , and when they come into new countries , they 're all very little money , and they don 't have a lot of money , they don 't have a lot of money , they don 't have a lot of money , or a lot of them .
So we can use international society to help our education , our English training , working with the job and all over the course .
We can also do the world around the world and the rest of the world in the face , because we 're all of the information that we have in the ground and the money that we send back to our lives .
And I 've been so lucky , and this is what I 've been doing , and what I 've been doing , since my life is to help , all of the people who are willing to do something that don 't want to do , a real idea of a dream today .
And I 'm sure that you 're going to see more of the people in the world that have to be successful in the world , including TED .
Thank you .
You might think this is a bad way to do .
And it 's UNK , and it 's a great material , but it 's not always a good material , but a lot of it 's going on , and not too , but especially , but also more of the time it 's going to be today , and not too , but especially in the winter that 's going on today .
There 's a lot of water on the road .
And the thing is , if you 're in a car , and I 'm not good at them .
And again , the UNK will produce a lot of noise .
And this material is kind of a little bit bad if we 're going to be able to get food food into the Netherlands , and we 're going to be careful with the noise .
The solution to that is to use a lot of UNK .
There 's a lot of UNK on the UNK , and there 's a lot of UNK water that 's going on , and the rain 's going down , and it 's going to get water that doesn 't have any water .
UNK are going to be missing in these caves .
Because there is a lot of holes , and there 's a lot of holes , and they 're quiet and they 're quiet .
Well , of course , there 's a lack of lack of the way , of course that 's going to be UNK .
What is it ? Look at the rocks on the road side .
And it starts with a couple of pieces , and more , and more of it -- I 'm not going to show it .
But they 're going to get bad enough glass . You 've got to be happy .
And finally , there 's a lot of damage out of that .
And sometimes it 's time to get UNK .
Yeah , he 's ready .
UNK is always the problem , but we have a solution .
And what you see here is the damage that 's going on in the material .
It 's UNK . It 's like me said , there are a few UNK out there .
And since the winds , the UNK and the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK .
If you run a way around that , you 'll get these things -- and we 're looking at it .
And to solve this problem , we think about ourselves materials .
If we could get away from that material , we could be able to figure out how to do it .
And what we 're doing is we 're clean up with a UNK paper that 's made out of steel , with a small piece of steel , and we take these little UNK into UNK .
So there 's a little UNK on the ground .
You need a machine like this . It can be used to cook .
You know , you can 't get a hot thing . You know , I think that 's really great .
So what we 're going to do is to put the piano into the steel and you put it into something that doesn 't even get rid of all the ones that get out of it .
So , I 'm sorry about that . I 'm here to use a little UNK here .
UNK are UNK UNK .
I put it in . I put it into something that looks out of what is happening .
This is what it looks like .
We have the tools in the lab that works with hot products .
And we tested a lot , and the government looked at the end , and they decided , " That 's interesting , we 're going to try it . "
And the government is going to do the very fast road , and 40 meters away from the UNK , and we 're doing something about materials .
And this is what we do . You see the experiment that 's been done , and of course , a couple of years later , and we all know this .
We have a lot of work on the road , and we 've got all these tools in the lab .
We did it because we did a lot of energy , and we had a lot of electricity , and we had a lot of pressure and a lot of heat and a lot of heat and testing .
We can do it again .
And the fact that this experiment is that we have to use our UNK machine in the way so that we 're going to put up an airplane on the road , and we 're going to get a lot of money on the road , and we 're going to save a lot of money .
So , what we 've created is that we 've made a material that allows you to get into a UNK , and you get the energy efficiency , and you can do more money than that , you know , with the simple technology .
You 're going to be able to get it out .
We look at this . We see it now .
In fact , I 'm going to tell you that it doesn 't get to me to get you to the heat or to make sure that it works .
But let 's try it again .
So , look , that 's true , that 's true .
Thank you .
I 'd like to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
There are a million birds on Earth .
UNK are one of the most UNK of extinction .
And when you look at the end of the bow , the first thing you see in the brain is that , you know , it 's kind of a terrible thing to do , and it 's something that doesn 't really do , and it 's a terrible thing to do , and it 's that people who don 't care about what they do , if you think about it , is that some of the things that are going to get out of the heart of the meat that 's going to get , and it 's going to be something that doesn 't really have to do with politicians to get to the politicians who are , and the people who are , of course , don 't get the fear of the people who don 't care about what they want to do , to people who don 't care about what they want to do , to people who are afraid of the life , to people who don 't care about what they want to do , to people who don 't care about what they want to do , to people
I want to change this view , and I want to change what people are doing , because they need our empathy . They really need it .
Let me tell you why .
And first of all , why do they give us the bad picture ?
UNK UNK from the UNK UNK in the West , and he said , " Well , these " UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " which is , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " which is , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " which is , " the UNK of the UNK , " the UNK of the UNK , " which is , " the UNK of the UNK , " which is , " the UNK of the UNK , " which is , " the UNK of the UNK , " which is , " the UNK of the UNK , " which is ,
You 're really hard to find more harmful than that , and these are what Charles Darwin said .
You know , you know , Darwin 's going to return to the United States , and I 'm going to tell you why .
UNK were still going to be known as a UNK , and became a UNK , and became a UNK .
And recently , if you 've been told about what 's going on here in Kenya , the state of Kenya in Kenya , they are now known as if they 're UNK or stupid , but I want to call it .
I 'm going to argue this . You know why ?
Because Congress 's not going to be able to maintain the natural environment .
You can 't stop the disease .
It 's almost impossible .
And they were very far away .
And again , my favorite idea is , you know , a lot better than that .
There are two UNK on this world .
And the UNK in the West has grown up in the United States since the United States and the United Kingdom and the United Nations , and in the most part of the continent , where there 's more than half of them on the continent , and there are 11 of them on the ground , and they have a very dangerous risk of extinction .
So what is important important ? Well , first of all , to get the important role on the ecosystem , and they clean up the environment .
UNK are our UNK .
They would take the meat out of the body clean .
They can get rid of all of their bodies , and they can harvest the virus and spread out of the virus , and they can take out of the water and the UNK to death and disease .
And recently , the most recent research is that there 's a lot of places that don 't look at all of the time that there 's no such a place where there 's no such time , and there 's a lot more opportunities between the body , and the disease will spread over to 40 times more likely to spread .
UNK is also a lot of history .
They 've also connected with ancient culture and ancient culture .
UNK UNK and women in the ancient and the mother and the mother and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and
And in the Indian language , the UNK of UNK , and he saved the UNK of UNK from the UNK of his life .
In the West culture , there is no reason why in the West , there are no trees , and there are no trees in the West , and so on where people provide a natural body system .
So what are the messages doing so many of these problems ?
Kenya is eight UNK long , and more than a half of them are extinct .
And a lot of people were killed by the fact that the people who are living in the field of living in the field of living in the living space of the living and the virus , and the drugs that make drugs use drugs that have died , and that 's what they 've been doing .
And in South Asia , one of the countries that they have in India have been wiped out of India in the past 15 years , because of that , because of what they 're going to get away from the end of 15 or 10 percent of the time , because they 're eating all the time that they are eating away from their lives in the past 15 years , because of the people who used to get away from their lives that they were eating as much as they could get away from their lives as they were eating .
Now there are some UNK UNK that can be used to use the use of India , India , India .
Because the UNK of UNK , and the UNK of the UNK , the UNK of the UNK , the UNK of the UNK , the UNK that he 's going to do , and they 're going to spread all over the place , and the bad thing is that there 's an awful growth rate in the India that 's going on in the field of the UNK and the UNK in India , and the bad thing about India is that there 's an awful growth in India .
And there are countries in Kenya that only have the largest mass efficiency of Africa : 35 UNK UNK , five years ago .
And I 'm not going to the wind , but we should be able to convince the state 's first threat , because the wind engine is going to be a threat threat to the birds , and the speed rate of the brain is going to fall down , and it 's about two and a half .
They are just UNK UNK .
In West Africa , some of the people who have died in the West and the UNK that he 's going to sell to be able to get into UNK and UNK demand .
What are we doing this ? We 're looking at these UNK , and we 're in them .
And we 're trying to figure out how to look and understand what 's going on in the environment .
And we find that they 're going to be all over the world , so if you 're a place , you 're very hard to get something .
We need to go with the local communities .
And we 're trying to deal with local countries .
And we 're trying to figure out what 's going on , and we 're really excited about what 's going on , and that the people who work in the nature of what they are doing , and the people who are doing what they 're doing .
What can you do ? You can act and tell you , and you can tell all of this stuff , and tell you what we need to do , and I need to tell you about what we need to do , and I need to tell you about what we need to do , to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you about the people who are going to tell you , and they 're going to
When you walk into this room , you 're UNK and you 're not going to tell your people , to tell you about the story of their neighbors .
They are so UNK , and Charles Darwin said that he 's going to change his own vision , and he 's looking at the center in the sky , and he 's like , and he 's going to get the rest of the peace in the sky .
Kenya , there are a lot of damage in Kenya , and there 's a lot of damage in the world .
Thank you so much .
And the people around us are around so many ways to help us live a better life .
We 're not quite sure that we all meet our neighbors , and even if we 're living in the same public space in the same public space , it 's hard to get caught up .
So in the last few years , I 've tried to work with different ways , like UNK and UNK and vegetables are sharing as much more stuff in the public space .
These projects are all from my own questions , how many houses do I have in my neighborhood ?
How do we get from the neighbors to each other from the neighbors , and at the end of the start ?
How do we get better care about the buildings that we have in order to understand our lives ?
How do we get the idea that we communicate to the space that we need to communicate with the space that we have in the context that we have now ?
I lived in New Orleans at a time , and I was very happy with this city .
These are all the big UNK in the life of my life , UNK , UNK and UNK , and I believe that the whole room is full of UNK .
Every time it 's time for me to wear a while , I feel like a UNK .
New Orleans had the most beautiful construction building , but also she could have the most UNK building buildings in the United States .
And I 'm living in this room , and I 'd like to think of another thing that 's going on in this community , and think about another thing that 's going to change my life .
In 2009 , I lost one of my favorites .
And her name is UNK , and she 's like me , and her mother , and her mother , and she 's all of a sudden , and nobody 's going to get it out of it .
And then I think a lot about death , and then I think that 's what I 've got to understand what I have in my life that seems to be truly what I think about what I think about my own life .
But I 'm very difficult to be living in a daily life .
I think that people are so important when you think about saving lives on the day of day , and forget about what is really important to be .
And I 've been working with a whole bunch of people who are up there , and I 'm just going to tell you a little bit about what 's going on in front of the room , and I 'm going to play a piece of food in the end of my life , and I want to share with them all the time in the public sector , and I want to share a little bit of them to share with them in the public room , and share a little bit of attention to them .
I don 't know what to do with this experiment , but the second day , the whole wall are eaten together , and they have a new answer .
I want to share with you some of the people who are writing on that wall .
" At the time of death , I 'd like to give my UNK behavior .
" At the time of death , I wanted to spread around the country and change the world . "
" At the time , I was thinking about millions of people 's audience . "
" At the death , I want a tree . "
" At the time of death , I wanted to live a living . "
" At the time , I thought I could do this again . "
" At the time , I wanted to become a guy . "
" At the time , I wanted to be able to do that real self . "
And this is really an actual building for a certain kind of structure that people have to do , and the people who are happy and dreams of my life , and the fear of my experience , and it 's time for me to play .
It made us believe that we were not alone .
So let 's start with the neighbors .
This is something that we built a UNK and a thinking of what we 're doing to change what is the most important thing that 's going on .
And a lot of people in the room that I 've been doing , and I 've got to get a little bit of the food in my community , and I 've been able to get some kind of stuff to my community , and I 've got to get a little bit of the people in the community , and I 've all been able to get some kind of a little bit of what 's going on in the community , and I 've all been able to get some kind of a little bit out of my community , and now I 've got to get a little bit of the people in my community , and here 's all over the world , and I 've all been able to get some sort of stuff on the side of my community , and I 've got to share a little bit of food , and I 've got to get a little bit of my colleagues , and I 've made a little bit of what 's happening here , and then there 's a whole bunch of them , and there 's a whole
These are the instructions , if we could have an idea of where people would share the opportunity to their own , and the public space would have a huge effect on it .
We all have the most precious things we have in common time , and there is a time between time and one .
When it comes from this thing , human desire to support me , remember life expectancy is going to be more important than anything else .
We don 't have the courage to talk about death ; we don 't even want to die until death , but I realized that I realized that I realized that I was able to get the most powerful thing to do with the power of the time that we could do this .
Think about how death can get your own life that makes your own life .
And the public space is so good for us to share a little bit of what we want to do , and what we 're doing to do is to help us create better places that are better , and more of us more lives than what we want to do .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And I 'm a UNK in California .
The air is hot . It 's too hard to get rid of the water .
And I could feel a lot of people who are coming up from the UNK , and I 've been able to get out of them , but in a dark way , I don 't see what other things are .
I hear a lot of people on the week , but I 've heard a lot of noise , but more of all of the noise that we 've heard over the sounds of UNK .
Like other people , I head up the top of the water 's water radiation , and I UNK the wall on the side of the wall , and I was able to touch the UNK on the wall , and I was able to touch the UNK on the wall , and I was able to touch the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I was able to get the UNK on the wall , and I had a
And my hand turned down , and it was to get me up , and he had a set of work on the back of the day , and he 's going to fall down the rest of his hand .
When I 'm here to talk to you today about today , these are the ones that come up to you today , and not too well , but not too much money , but not too much .
And I ended up , and I went out , and I got home , and I was able to get away from all of these people who were able to get away from the end of the election , where they were never going to be able to die from the end of my family .
I 've been traveling from my UNK in the last two years since 2007 , and I am very fortunate to be sure that I 've been able to do what I 've been able to do , and I 'm very happy to be able to support the UNK in New York , and I 've been very lucky enough to be able to support the UNK and the UNK in 2009 .
And I met a lot of people , and I know a lot of people who believe in the UNK of UNK , where the organization has to rely on the support of our modern society .
When I talk about slavery , and I started to really understand what I 'm doing , but I 'm always sure that the whole thing that I 've already told you is that I 've always known about what 's going on , but I 've always known about what 's going on in the world , but it 's not all of a matter of what 's going on .
And at the end of my talk , I felt so bad and because I didn 't even know what to do with the situation that there was so many people who don 't know about what I don 't know , and how many of you don 't even know what I don 't know how many people think they don 't know what I don 't know , and how many of you don 't even know what I don 't know how many people think they don 't know what I don 't know , and how many of you don 't even know what I don 't know how many people think they don 't know what I don 't know , and how many of you don 't even know what I don 't know how many people think they don 't know what I don 't know , and how many of you don 't even know what I don 't know .
And this idea for me to spend a lot of hard time , I flew to Los Angeles , and I went to see the people in Los Angeles , who wanted to be doing it .
And since it started my journey that I 've come into .
And the strange thing is , these are the places that I 've been doing .
And one of them that I did was my second story .
But this time , I 'm going to try to get the secret to the people who don 't .
Information estimates that today are more than 20,000 million people in the world today .
This is the number of people who have sold from the UNK in the Atlantic , and it 's twice as much as likely to be sold in the United States .
150 years ago , a farmer became a UNK about three times the number of people in the United States of America .
It 's like a million dollars today .
But today , a whole home is going to have 18 dollars in the modern world .
And what 's surprising is that the consumer workers in the world are more than a billion dollars a year .
And a lot of them are , of course , because of all of the people who are in trouble , and the kids are good , and good , good jobs are going to get away from violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not going to get rid of the violence , and they 're not
Today , more of all of this is about business in business about the business of business , but the consumer people are being locked down everywhere .
The consumer is that every single corner in the world , even though it doesn 't have to be illegal .
In India and Tanzania , I was brought up to the UNK .
It 's a little bit like there 's a sense of what 's going on here , but it 's like it 's in Egypt and it 's called UNK .
And a lot of people who are in the top of 50 , a child , a child , a child , a little bit of their head , and they 're going to move to the surface and get rid of the water , and then it 's all over the course of the Mola , and then it 's all over the last few hundred kilometers of water , and then there 's a UNK on the back of the Mola .
UNK and UNK are up , and they 're quiet for their lives , and it 's time for about 17 hours a day .
It 's not going to be able to grow up , don 't eat food , you don 't drink the water , and they don 't need to have a toilet .
And since there 's a lot of heat and dust on the water that I 've just gotten out of my camera , it 's not going to work .
Every 20 minutes , I 've got to get out of my device on the back of the air , and if you 're in a car , and I 'm sitting in a car , and I 'm just going to get a lot of attention to my own life , to be able to get more of my life than those of you who are living in the future , and you can see more people than the people who are living in the back of the room .
When I went back to my home , I was not thinking of myself crying , but a UNK of UNK , and he said , " UNK , he 's crying , and he 's crying . "
And then he said to me that this map was so dangerous to me to understand what I was doing , because these guys are people .
I 'm not allowed to give them any direct help .
I can 't afford them . I 'll give it away .
I 'm not a citizen of that country .
I think that 's going to be possible , and that 's going to be better .
I just wanted to UNK UNK , and I can tell you how they can do it .
So to me , I 've got to go back to my home and try to get it out of it .
And when you think about the UNK , I 've seen all the hard kids walking around in the last few kilometers on the side of the road , waiting for a few kilometers away from the road .
These are all the kids who are going to move to the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK ,
Now , this is an incredibly painful thing to see .
How do we get something to do something that hide the face , and yet the UNK have sex ?
And some people don 't even think they 're in the age of a man when they 're killing each year a year , because they come from this place like this .
There is no problem .
If these people need to be free for their own citizens , they lose all of them .
These people who are so bad about what they 're doing , and what they 're doing right now is they 're going to throw out , but the people in the room who want to get rid of the people who are going to help them , and what they 're going to do is , and what they 're going to do is , and what they 're going to do is , and what they 're going to do is , and what they 're going to do is , and what they 're going to do is to take the rest of the people who are going to take the rest of the place , and where they 're all going to do the same thing , and where they 're all going to do , and they 're going to take the rest of the people who are there , and you can get to them , and you can get to the people who have them , and they have the freedom to do it right now .
And the thing that 's really important is that we 're listening to what 's going on in front of the media because I 've been hearing what I 've been told to do , and when I 've been hearing about what I 've been told to you , I 've been told I 've been told that I 've been told that my life is actually going to get stuck .
And I 'm very proud of this because of some of the women that I 've been told about sex .
And they brought me down a piece of UNK , and they went into a dirty space .
This is not a UNK .
It 's more like a restaurant hall .
UNK restaurants are familiar with people who are forced to sell care of their lives .
A little bit of a small time , women and children and children and children and children , and to make sure they consume more food and a lot of them .
Every little thing is dark up on a dirty wall , and you can draw a word on the third floor and the windows .
And the people who work here are all UNK UNK .
When I 'm standing there for a few of the dark , I remember feeling a little bit of an awful lot of fear of fear , and I 'm thinking of what I 've been thinking about , for many of the time in this place .
So here 's one out of a room : That 's what I came up with .
There were no way .
There were no windows left .
These are all of the problems that we don 't do so hard to tell us about the hard question that we have , and it 's important to have sex , and it 's in our backyard as well .
Millions of people are farmers , and family workers don 't stop there .
And recently , the New York Times has about 10 million to 30 million children in the U.S.
These things happen in us ; we just don 't know what to do .
UNK are what we 've heard about the consumer workers .
I visited a village in India where I visited a village called UNK .
This is a guy called " UNK . "
And those are the ones that get infected in the home and the red and red are the hands of two sons .
They were UNK out of the UNK , and then UNK the UNK up into the needle , until the UNK came up , and they were all UNK out of the virus .
UNK to tell me their stories .
We said , " We 're not free . " And we said yes .
" Can you hope , if you want this room to get away from the room to get the rest of the place where it 's going to get paid in there . "
And the data is that there are more than 400 of them in the world 's lives , and there are the largest people in the world .
And we went to that , and I went to see a little bit .
And I 'm looking at the guy who 's been looking up in the boat , two brothers , a few of them , are like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few hours , a little bit of a few hours .
UNK ! They 're all UNK .
And the kids are brought out of their lives on the side of the water , and they 're working on the lake , and they 're not going to go too well .
This little boy is eight years old .
When our boat were looking up , he 's looking up at the back of the boat , and he was shocked , and he was on the other side of his boat .
He 's afraid that he 's going to die .
There are the UNK on the side of the lake , and the UNK children are going to get to get rid of the water .
A lot of people die .
From the course he started , and was forced to work on the lake .
He was very scared , and he 's not going to be able to get away from him because he 's so used to get out of his little other way .
When I first had four of these kids in the morning , you know , at the end of the morning , they start working on the morning .
On the cold cold , the wind evening .
You know about this UNK , there are thousands of pounds .
I 'm going to introduce you to UNK .
He 's from a UNK village .
And he 's found this guy in a single place called UNK UNK , who used to be able to get part of the victims of the patient 's disease .
And there he is on the side of his hand , and on the side of his hand , there 's a lot of people who are able to get their home together , and they 're all going to be able to get their care of the way that they 're going to be doing what they 're doing .
UNK is one of the possibilities .
And because there 's a person who 's going to show you that there 's an impact on his life that he can all be able to change .
So , when it comes to Ghana , there 's a guy on UNK , a guy who 's a UNK man and he 's going to get closer and closer into our cars , go to the window .
He made us to change his path , and he walked into the jungle .
In the course , he 's forced us to get the cars out of the car .
And then he pointed up on the ground , and he said , " This is it . It 's here . This is the road ! "
We walked out of the road , and we walked out of a small period of water that went into a very long time , and I was able to take a look at the top of the brain so that he could put his hand on the top of the hot water .
And then there are two and a half a little bit , and there 's a lot of holes in the space that we 've seen in front of the space that we have , and there 's a lot of holes on the side of the wall , and there are all kinds of holes in the dark room that every single hole in the field has gone on , and there are all kinds of things on the ground , and there are all kinds of things on the side of the wall .
A lot of women and a little bit of their children , and they 're walking down into the water .
UNK are UNK .
These people are HIV in one place in Ghana .
And when they go out of the train , they go into the UNK .
I remember that they were full of UNK in the dark , and most of them were made out of UNK for seven hours .
These are all kinds of people who come up with their UNK bags , and they can take the rest of the water , and you can get rid of these areas .
So , in fact , the guy who 's on the UNK are really healthy , but we 're looking at some of the workers that people have found on the ground , and there 's a lot of children in the back of the present .
These are the victims of chronic violence .
In fact , these muscles are so likely that you can tell people how to do the same thing if you 've ever been able to do with the virus and the lungs in the end of the virus ?
This is Martin UNK , who was his uncle at his age , and he sold himself to his job .
When he died at his uncle , UNK UNK were going to continue to continue his uncle 's UNK , and he was forced to continue to continue to work .
And when I met him , he 's working on a UNK , a long time ago in a UNK , where the doctor 's got a little bit of a time ago .
In this case , he 's suffering from his lungs , and he has to run every day without a day of a day .
And even though , he 'd like to be able to focus on the organization that he helped you , and it 's really hard for me to imagine how to think about what they are , like , a lot of the things that really don 't seem to think of the way that people think so hard to see the people that don 't want to be so hard to imagine that the people I 'm going to do so .
And I hope we give these people back .
And when I took a photograph of my camera , I took a lot of UNK to my UNK , and I 'd let them tell you what I 'd like to do , and I wanted to make a photograph of them , and when I was all of them , and I made this series , and I took a series of photos to them .
They knew about these images as well .
I want to let them know that we 're going to figure out what we can do for all of them .
I 'm really sure that if we take them together , they 're going to be very hard to do it .
These are all of these stories , and what people really want to do is , and what people do , and what I 've got to do is to make sure that everyone 's in my life , and have sex and respect it in my life .
I 'm not going to think about this beautiful , but I 've never heard about this in my life , but a lot of people who might meet them in my life .
And what I want to do with these images is to be the ability to get the power in the center of the people that I want to share with you today , because if there is so many possible here to get into the power of the person who 's going to be able to grow up in the wild , because if there is no such thing that 's going to be able to stay alive on the shadow of my particular life ?
Thank you .
Well , I 'm learning how to use math , and to say one particular thing , is that we have a lot of money to do with the math that we 're working with .
Nobody knows what we 're doing .
So I 'm going to tell you what we 're doing .
Well , dancing is one of the activities of human beings .
We were going to dance and UNK and UNK and all the things that you 're going to know about .
There is a very important technology that 's going to be known today , and the UNK skills of this is really what it might be like to say .
But , of course , what 's going on with the nervous system , the nervous system , such as a result of an UNK that 's actually going to destroy me , and this is what happened to me , and he 's a guy in his life .
These years later , and he 's a lot of treatments with a lot of treatments .
However , there are 60,000 million people who have this disease , and they 've got to be able to get away from the treatment of their suffering , and they 've gotten out of the tools that we need to communicate with the tools that we need to use .
We need to look at what the brain is going to look at the end of the treatment , and you need to figure out what 's going to be able to get the idea of the problem that we have to do , and we all have the idea that we have the idea that we have the ability to be able to figure out how to solve those questions .
But the thing about this is that the UNK and the other people who are going to get out of food , none of them have not been able to do what we could do , and that 's not what we could do .
You 've got to get out of the clinic , and they spend a lot of time , and a lot of them never did before in clinical trials , never ever did before .
But what if patients could do this test ?
How could it be going to take the rest of the patient , if the patient 's going to be able to do this ?
No need to spend a lot of money to hire employees .
And by the way , if you go to the UNK , the cost is 300 dollars .
So I want to tell you a very important approach that we could try to get around because you know , or at some point , even if you think about it , at least , in a way , what we are all of them is like me .
And I have a video about UNK .
And one of the things that we think about the health of our minds is that we think of ourselves as a sound called " The UNK , " because when we 're trying to communicate with these UNK , what 's true about this is that we 've got to do these things together , like , you know , this is what we do .
And as well as a result , it needs to be trained .
You can think of it as long as a child .
In the sound of sound , we can look at the UNK of the sound that the UNK can affect us as well as we can influence the organ .
You can see the bottom line of the bottom , you can see a kind of a UNK .
And we saw something like this .
UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK .
And it 's going to be a little bit and talk about a lot more of the things that are all these things .
And in fact , most of these UNK are really hard to use , but it 's very , very , very , very hard to be able to take care of the rest of the world , but it 's very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
So , these are all kinds of examples of the language , and how do they communicate with the power of expertise , how do you actually have sex ?
UNK is UNK , and they use all of the infrastructure .
You don 't need to design a whole new hospital .
And they 're all of them , and of course it 's true , but based on the audio in the language are not alone .
That means the patient can do it .
And it 's about 30 seconds , and more than 30 seconds .
UNK is low . We know how to do it .
And once it 's cheap , it can be spread on .
And I 'm here to tell you what a great goal .
We can reduce the problem and the patient we have .
It 's not going to be an example of what 's been done .
And we can take a high school monitor to monitor the data .
And we can make a lot of the UNK tools , and we can make a lot of the scale on the first time in our time .
We also have a chance to start looking for this disease in the early days of life on the patient .
So today , from the end of my life today , we started this project with UNK UNK .
And UNK UNK with UNK UNK , and we want to record the world 's attention to all of the people in the world to get these four targets .
And we have a digital phone on the planet , and it 's about 25,000 million people .
Any health or the patient 's population is going to be able to get out of the people who are going to be able to be able to get out of the guy who 's going to be able to get out of the UNK , and I 'm so happy to tell you that we get seven percent of the time that we 've seen in the eight hours of our life .
Thank you .
UNK , for these kind of people , you can tell what they are healthy , who is HIV ?
What do you want to get out to that ?
Right , yeah . So , you 've got to have time in front of the room , and you 've got to tell us that you 're going to have this disease , TED .
You know , there are some people who can tell us , or whatever .
But we 're going to be able to get huge data from different sources of information , because of that , because that 's what we can do , because we can stop away from all of these different factors that have to do so .
So you 've got 18 percent of the time now .
It 's too far away .
In fact , my students , by the way , one of my students , who made a lot of work , and now he 's now shown that he 's going to be able to figure out how that he 's going to be able to do this , and now he 's now shown that he 's going to do this all the time , and now he 's now right now to get 99 percent of all the time now .
And nine nine nine , you know , it 's great .
So , the reason that people can do this is to get people to get their phone calls into their cell phone , and their doctors can get them and figure out where they 're going on , and they 're in the middle of the disease , and they 're going to be able to tell them where they 're going to get into this disease .
This is what it is .
Thank you so much . UNK UNK and all of us .
Thank you .
I was able to get out of the camera , and I 've always been fascinated , but I 'd like to share with you some of my favorite pictures of my favorite book , and they 're not there .
There is no artist ; there 's no architect , and there 's not a big chance , and there 's more light .
In fact , most of them are UNK .
My story of mine is a picture of me , and my wife took a picture , and my wife took a picture , and I was my daughter , and my wife 's birthday , and I was standing in the age of about seven and a half .
After a year , we went back to New York City , and we decided to do a photograph .
You can guess what 's going on .
When she was eight years old , and she said , " Hey , why don 't you just take a look at New York City from New York , a father that 's going to take away from this little bit ? "
And this is where we start to get our way out of the road .
You know , you know , you know , you 've got to get a lot of people who are so familiar and how often you 're looking at it , and not so often .
No one is going to tell it , and the lucky thing is , there are no other people running away from us .
At the time , we didn 't know that the journey would change our lives .
For us , it starts to become sacred .
This is a few weeks after 9 / 11 , and I was trying to figure out what happened when I was trying to figure out what happened when I was a teenager that came out of 15 years ago .
So these are not just recorded a moment or a special journey .
The way that we 're living in the past 10 months of time , we 're going to think about the year of the last 10 months , and as a result of what we 're going on , and how we 're going to change a change on the planet , and that 's all change in the same way that we think over time , and again , and all of the things that are different from our bodies .
Because , as many years , as a child , as a child , and her vision and her vision , I 've seen her eyes , and I 've seen my eyes and see how to do everything .
This is the moment that we live in a year , and a lot of the time we have in the last year .
And in the last journey , we were walking around the road , and she stopped down , and she was very happy with the guy who said , " Well , when she was a little girl , she was very happy , and she was coming back with a journey to start with our journey .
She was very proud to her when I was 15 years old .
She said she could see the last time she was looking up , and she was going to jump up , and he was nine years ago .
And now she 's looking at the University of New York , because she 's decided to go to New York .
And suddenly I understood that the most important thing that we 've created is our memories .
So I want to share with this kind of insight and figure out how to create memories .
I don 't know what you 're doing , but I 'm a person , and I 'm not going to have a photograph in my family .
I 'm always the guy who 's taken out of the camera .
And I 'd like to encourage you to come in and get to the photo , get to the top of the room , get to the front and say , " Can you help us get there ? "
Thank you .
