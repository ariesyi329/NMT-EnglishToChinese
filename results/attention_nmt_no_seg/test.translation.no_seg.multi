When I was 11 years old , I remember a day , and I have a morning , and I 've heard a lot of them .
My father was using his red UNK UNK .
And he was smiling , and it 's so rare , because most of the news is going to hurt him .
" UNK ! " My father .
I don 't know what that means , but that I can see the father .
" You can go to a real school . " He said .
I never forget the morning .
A real school .
When I was six years old , I graduated from high school and decided it was illegal to me .
So in the last five years , my daughter came to my sister with a secret school teacher , and it wasn 't allowed to be alone .
And this is the only way we 're on the patient 's only education .
We 're going to run different circuits so that we don 't know where we 're going .
We put the book on food UNK , and we 're going to think that we 're going to go to the store .
School in a room , and we were 100 people in a room .
It 's a very uncomfortable day , and it 's summer .
We all know that the danger of life is the danger of life , and the student , the students , they 're all understood .
Sometimes , they were going into the school because they were told by the Taliban .
We were always worried about the Taliban .
Are we there ?
Do they know where we are ?
We were scared , but we were still thinking about schools .
I was very lucky to live in a family education , and I love my family home .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man in his life .
And he was born in Afghanistan , and they were all familiar with others , and my mother and her father , and it 's forced to tell the father of his father by his father .
But the mother has become a teacher .
And that 's her .
She 's two years ago , and he turned out to be a school and a school girl and women in the school community .
My father -- it 's him -- he 's the first person in his family .
So unfortunately , his children should be educated , including his daughter , even though it 's time , and it 's risk .
And he said , kids don 't get to be a great risk for him .
And the most years that I remember when I was there , I remember when I was there , I remember that I 'm going to be scared , and that 's when I 'm going to die in my life , and I 'm not going to die in the future , and I 'm not going to see the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get the future , and I 'm not going to get
I think I want to leave you there , but my father says , " Listen , my daughter , you 're going to lose anything in your life .
You can be hacked . You can get the war out of the war .
And the only thing you can get away from the place is that we don 't have to be able to pay your money to pay you to pay to pay for your money to pay you to pay attention to you , we 're going to have to pay for your money to pay you to pay attention to you , we 're going to spend the money we need to pay for you to pay for your money to pay you to pay for your money to pay you to pay for your money to pay you to pay for your money to pay you to pay for your money to pay you to take care of money to pay you to take care of money .
But if you don 't want to continue again ? "
Today I 'm 22 years old .
What I 've done is that the country in the last few decades have been destroyed in the last few years .
I grew up with a young people in my life , and I 'm not about 60 percent of my life , and if it 's not my family , I 'm going to be like a lot of people .
And I 'm here to be a very proud UNK student .
Richard UNK is one of the UNK of America in America , and when I went to Afghanistan , and my grandfather , my grandfather , is to tell you how to do this .
And he 's not just more than a college student , because I 'm the first one in women , and I 'm the first one in women , and I 'm the first one in women , and I 'm the first one in women in the face , and I 'm the first one in women ; I 'm the first one in women ; I 'm the first one in women ; I 'm the first one who 's in the face ; I 'm the first one who 's in the face ; I 'm the first one in the woman who 's going to be the first person who 's going to be the first person in UNK , and I 'm the first one in the woman who 's going to be the first person in UNK , and I 'm the first one in the woman who 's going to be the first person in UNK , and I 'm the first one in the woman who 's going to be the first person in UNK , and I 'm the first one in the woman who 's going to be the first
My family trust me .
My dream is so big , but they 're better for my expectations .
And this is why I became a UNK , and it 's a global UNK for women 's health .
And that 's the reason that I 've been involved , and the reason why this is the first one can be is the only place in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , the only one is the only place where Afghanistan is going to be really dangerous .
So what I 'm really excited is , you know , I see my students are able to get the chance out , and they 're going to get big .
And I saw some of them , and I saw them their father , as my father made of my father , and by the way that my father did so .
So for example , this is not true , it 's not true , but he 's my father 's father .
But a month later , and he and his daughter went to school in school , and they die from the ground .
And when he 's home , he said , " He 's going to school if he 's going to school the girl on the girl , and then he 's going to go back to school , and then it 's going to happen again again .
" If you think that 's going to kill me now , " he said , " but I 'm not going to die in the future of my daughter . "
And because of Afghanistan , I realized that this is true of the state ; it 's not that one of the other women , and it 's the other side of my life , and that 's what he is doing , and that 's what he 's doing , and he 's about his daughter 's job , and he 's about his own job , and he 's making his own job about his own daughter , and it 's about his own job .
It 's not that the mothers are not important for our success .
In fact , for the great future of girls , they 're usually the most popular and most powerful ones that we have , and we have to be a man in Afghanistan , and we have to have a male support of Afghanistan .
When I went to school , there were hundreds of young girls in school , and they don 't forget , and that 's not illegal enough .
But today , Afghanistan has more than 300 million of their education today .
Afghanistan is very different in the United States .
I 've found that Americans can see the vulnerability in change .
I 'm afraid that the change will be as long as the U.S. military .
But when I went to Afghanistan to see my students and support them , I saw the future 's future . And I saw this change going on .
For me , Afghanistan has an infinite possibility and everything that every day , every day , every day , every single day .
Like , like me , there 's a great dream .
Thank you .
What I do , I 'm doing what I 've done , and who 's going to be the whole man who lived in Africa , and it 's all about the seven years that it 's going to be young years old in Africa 's life .
I was 17 and 19 of 17 years , and I saw a lot of young people , but I was very young , and I was in the United States , and we had now done a lot of work in Africa .
And I was working in a country called UNK UNK , and we grew up every project in Africa , and we failed .
And I 'm so slow .
And at the age of the day , I think we were a lot of people , and we were doing a great job for Africa .
And yet , what we do ?
So the first project gives me to write the first book , book , " UNK " in this project .
So , we 've got a great idea of what we can do with a lot of people in South Asia , and we 're talking about the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and so on .
And of course , as local beings are familiar with this , so we pay a lot of money for them , and they 're all in a minute .
There 's this great UNK , where local people are not going to be really surprised , and we 're really surprised to it .
But we don 't ask them why , and we just said , " We 're here . "
" UNK [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [ UNK ] [ UNK ] ] [
And of course , in Africa , of course , are very good in Africa .
And we are so beautiful , and in Italy , this is so big in Italy , in Italy , in Italy , and it 's so big .
It 's unbelievable . We talk about what people say , " Look , that 's more easy . "
And when the UNK has done , the red seems so close to the left , and from UNK to all the rest of the South Bronx , you can see all the UNK in the West .
And we said , " Oh God , this is dead . "
And ordinary people say , " Yeah , that 's what we don 't get there . "
" Why don 't you say " and " you said . "
I just wanted to say that we have a big number of people who are living in Africa , but when I know that Americans are really proud of what we 're doing , when we 're in the United States , when we 're talking about them , we 're very proud of what we are doing , and we 're so proud of what we 're doing a great job .
Because we ate the UNK .
You should look at these UNK -- you can tell us how much food we have .
You can read this book , it 's called " UNK , " which is Bill Gates , an American economist .
This book was published in 2009 .
These are the state aid aid in the last 50 years to Africa in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you how the money works for money .
You 're going to read them .
So you can see a lot of women 's eyes , and we get a lot of fear .
We are the UNK , the UNK , and the teachers , and the teachers , we are both in the middle of the conversation , and the people are in the middle of the conversation .
These two words come from the word " UNK , " " father . "
And the two words are different .
And they were willing to tell me that if I was going to spread the people in my life , my children were going to be thinking , " I love your child . "
You know , they 're very happy to me , and I 'm not going to make a narrative of people who want to get me wrong .
And this is why Africa is called UNK , and it 's the UNK .
When I was reading the book book , it was a very nice time , and it was called " UNK , " which is the most important thing to do , and if people don 't want to help someone else , they 're not going to want to help someone else 's , if they don 't want to help someone else 's .
This should be the main principle of aid .
The first part of the cost of aid is to respect respect .
So today , this conference next to the end of this conference , and said , " We can 't do this -- you know , can you really be able to figure out that a whole town is not going to be able to think of the city that you can 't be able to figure out that the city is not going to be able to think of the city that you can 't be able to see a city that you can 't be able to see a city that you can 't be able to see a city that you can 't be able to see a city that you can 't be able to imagine in the city -- you can 't be able to imagine that the city is not going to be thinking about the city that you can 't imagine ? "
When I was 16 years old , I made a decision , just for people who need to get help , and what people do is , what people who want to be as people who are not as people who want to be as people who are as people who are , and why are the people who want to be creative , as people who think , as people who think they 're not going to want to , you know , people who think they want to be .
So what we 're going to do is we 're doing it .
We go into a community where we don 't have to think about the idea of that , and they 're waiting for them .
We don 't have a job on our office .
We were playing with the UNK and the UNK .
We don 't have any infrastructure .
What we do is , they share a lot of people , and they 're really interested in what they 're interested .
And the most important thing is the passion .
You can give your attention to your ideas .
But how don 't really care about it , what do you do ?
UNK have been the most important thing to join from me .
The passion is based on the basis of my own , and that 's the most important thing .
And then we could help them know about knowledge and information , because it 's not the case that 's not the case in the world , and not in the end of the world .
A little bit of people don 't know a lot about understanding of what we can do .
So a lot of years ago , I had a thought that we could not have a better way of thinking about how to read their ideas , but it 's not going to be able to listen to them , but that 's not going to work with our ideas of society .
I 'm going to tell you a secret .
The community has a problem .
UNK don 't spread , and they 're not going to tell you about what they 're doing in the public , and they 're able to figure out where they 're going to get the money they 're going to tell you about what they 're doing .
So there 's an accident .
You don 't even recognize the most smart people in the community community , because they don 't even tell any of your public share .
And what we do is , we share a problem with the experts , and we need to build a kind of social infrastructure that we need to build .
We have to create a whole new career .
This is a professional family , a professional family doctor , where you 're living in your home room , and if you 're living in your home room , you 've got to get your life into the energy energy .
I worked with my UNK in UNK , California .
At the time , I was reading , and I was able to do this all the UNK that he did to get up with the UNK UNK .
When I was in my first year in UNK , and I was the first client in my house , and I said , " You know , I 'm the first client guy , and I 'm going to do it for the first time , and I 'm going to do this guy who 's going to sell you to sell a UNK ? "
I 've got these five UNK guys who are not doing a UNK job of UNK dollars for about 15 dollars in the United States , and I 'm going to pay them to say , " Hey , don 't help us pay attention to the UNK , and say , " Hey , can you help us with the cost of UNK dollars for about 15 dollars ? "
A year of six years , I 've done about 25 projects , and the government workers came up and asked me , " How did you do that ?
How can you do it ? " I said , " I 've done a hard problem .
There they are . You know . "
So -- the government says , " That 's why . "
We started this project in the world and 300 of them .
We 've done hundreds of UNK companies .
A new generation of creativity are being cut by UNK cars .
Peter UNK , one of the greatest UNK of UNK , two years ago now , five years old .
Peter UNK has been a philosopher 's degree , and he said , " The way that we 're talking about is this is a time when we 're talking about innovation , and we say , " This is something that 's really important for innovation and creativity is really good for innovation . "
And it 's going to create the creativity for innovation .
Now , we 're going to build them to Australia , and I don 't know where the most powerful people in Europe are , how do they use their money and the power of their own resources ?
And we 've got to learn how to get the people out of that .
And we have to give people the promise of them , and respect the privacy , and we need to be able to help them , so they can play .
A thousand people in a 100 years , we have 200 customers .
Do you want to imagine about a thousand people in the world , and how much of the forces are going to be ?
How many of you here are you going to give you to hear the world today ?
You know , people have sex . You guys care for them .
So what I want to say is , creativity is the flow of modern society .
When we were working on the first age of the first revolution , we could not be able to grow fossil fuels , and we could realize that it 's not sustainable .
UNK fuel uses a long day .
UNK in UNK , and it 's very long .
What we 're going to focus on is how we can take a sustainable world to live 70 billion people , health , education , education , whatever we need .
There 's a lot of technology that can 't do that .
Who 's going to be able to figure out the technology for this technology ? How do it work ? Don 't think !
UNK ? Don 't !
And it 's business , and that 's what they 're fighting for .
A lot of years ago , I saw a funny article on a global version .
So , in 1960 , there were experts who were invited to talk about what the future will look like in New York City .
So this is UNK , and this is where we have all over 100 years of New York , and they say , " The New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , the New York , is 10 years later , will be no longer anymore .
Why ? Because they look at the surface lines , and if people are going to continue to grow up in the last 10 years , they 're going to be six million people in the New York , and they 're going to spend six million of them , and they 're going to be going to buy six million of them .
People are going to be UNK .
So in 1960 , they thought that the UNK technology will kill the life of life .
So what happens ? 40 years later , 1990 , in 1990 , one of the countries in the United States have 10 dollars per capita -- 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 10
There 's a new kind of technology that 's been developed by the new technology , and there 's a lot of work on the ground .
Like UNK UNK , UNK UNK .
However , it 's a secret for innovation .
First of all , you 're going to give them the promise .
And they 're not going to get you talking .
And then you need to focus on the focus on the ground .
You 're going to tell them that they are truly real .
And it 's not that big companies are so small to be able to get the three things to do the next thing : the quality of the product is , and the private sector works , and the private sector works .
What is the problem ?
There 's never been a person doing a good job or a marketing job .
This one is no longer .
Such human beings happen .
So we went to study , and there are hundreds of companies in the world , and they 're training companies , and they 're like UNK companies , UNK , UNK , UNK .
There 's a success in the world , and one in the world , there 's only one thing : there 's one thing that 's one in the world .
Now we 're going to do this in UNK , and I 'm about to tell you this number of years ago , and we 're going to do this , and we 're going to think about this word , and we 're going to say , " We 're going to do this word " and we 're going to do this word " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and " and the students on the UNK ! "
" I don 't have any time . "
He 's beginning to be a UNK .
No one is not going to create a company . Nobody .
So we can build a community , and we have a little bit of UNK in the community , and we have the help of doing this , and we 're going to give you the help of the UNK , and we 're going to ask you to give you what 's going to get out of the work that we can provide , and we can ask you to take care of that problem , and we can ask you what 's going on with you , and we 're going to give you the help of the UNK , and we can ask you what 's going on with you , and we 're going to give you the help of the UNK , and we 're going to ask you to give you what 's going to get a great job that 's going to take you to get out of all of us , and say , " What do you need to take care of ? "
Can you do it ? Can you create it ?
Can you sell it out ? You can make a big job ? "
" Well , I don 't know that . " " You know , why don 't you want to help you ? "
We dance all of them in the community .
So we have a volunteer group of people who are helping us , the consumer leaders and the customers , and what we found is that the people in the audience are able to create the idea of people , the mind , the vision of people , the vision of people , the vision of people , the vision of people , the vision of people , the vision of people , the vision of people , the vision of people , the vision of people .
Thank you .
Five years ago I was there with a whole bunch of amazing UNK .
I teach my college students to teach the students in schools to study the students in schools .
I was shocked .
I 'm really scared . These students have seen the brain , and they 're able to figure out what they 're doing , and what they 're going to use , and what they use , is that they use a whole bunch of words that they use , and they use it , and they use it as a result that they use , and they use it as a result that they use , and they use a lot of them as a result that they use , and they use this as a result that they use , and they use it as a result that they use , and they use the language that they use , and they use the same thing as they use , and they use it as a result that they use , and they use the word " The words that they use and " and " and " and " they use , " and " they use " and " and " and " and " and " and the words they use , and the language that they use , and the language they use ,
But before the conversation , my experience was like , " UNK , " he 's going to look like that , and he looks like this UNK and a UNK for the whole world .
And that 's what I 've learned from my students , and I 'm so surprised to them , and I hope that other people can experience this in the context of the situation .
And I believe that the goal of the door to open the door is that it 's going to be good for communication and communication .
In order to change the world , we need to learn from our scientists and engineers from our scientists .
And our scientists and engineers and all the problems that we face are the most of the biggest challenges that we don 't understand , and when we don 't understand the situation , they don 't understand what they 're doing , and what we don 't really know is , what if we don 't understand the world , and if we don 't understand it , they don 't understand what they do , and I believe that we don 't know what they 're doing , and what we don 't know is , if we don 't understand the problem , and if we don 't understand it , they don 't understand what they 're doing , and what we don 't know is , if we don 't understand the problem , and if we don 't understand it , they don 't know what to do with them , and what we don 't know is , if we don 't understand the situation , they don 't understand what they 're doing , and what we don 't really know is , if we don 't understand where they are ,
But if our scientists and engineers are not going to look at us to look at the context of their environment , we can just be able to actually have a good deal with them .
So scientists and engineers and tell us about what technology is .
And I 'd like to share a few ways to tell you how to do it , and tell you how to do it so that we might think of your science as well as your science , your UNK .
And the first question to answer the question : How about technology ?
Tell us , why your science is all about us .
I can tell you how the bones are , you know , I 'm making a little bit of bone , and I 'm going to tell you how it 's that a bone is because it 's very important to think about this animal 's brain is that it 's so important to recognize the tissue of the bone in the brain , and it 's very important for this bone .
And then when you look at the science , they 're going to focus on the language .
Language is a lack of what we want to do .
And of course , you can say , " When do you think " How do you say " space " and " right ? " it means more about us .
You might think it 's easy , and it 's not like easy to make it easy .
Instead , it 's like Einstein -- it 's not as easy as easy as you can .
You don 't have to change your mind so you can tell you about your science .
So for some examples , a few examples , and a lot of them , these are all of you , and we 're really excited to be able to tell us about what they 're doing .
There 's also a time to tell you how to do it , and don 't use it .
You want to figure out what a word is called " UNK ? "
What is it ? " UNK , you can kill your report .
They don 't just ignore the video , but with the language of our brain , we don 't know what to do .
This is from UNK UNK , and it 's so good to tell you that the easy thing is good enough to say that it 's going to be very complex in UNK , and it 's going to be a very good example of what 's called UNK .
And the door is to use it easy , to use the idea that people don 't understand what they 're doing , and then they 're going to be able to appreciate what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we 're going to tell you what we 're thinking about , and then we can tell you what
So these are the things that I think is going to help us to open up the door of science to science and engineering .
Because the engineers who worked with me , who taught me to communicate the philosophy of my life , I wanted to do a little bit of my way of thinking about it .
You 're going to do science science , and you 're going to lose a little bit of words and language , you know , just about being a great idea of what you 're doing , and it 's going to tell you about what 's going on in your mind , and it 's going to be as important to tell you about what 's going on the idea that we 're doing right now , and that 's what we 're trying to do with all of you , and that 's what we 're doing , and that 's what we 're trying to tell you about how we 're doing right now .
So , scientists and engineers , when you 've solved this process , you want to do everything , and tell me about technology .
Thank you .
I love the word " one is called the UNK English . "
Not so that sounds great .
And it means " a UNK . "
And even though this is just a great answer to something that 's a great definition , he said , " UNK . "
I don 't know about " UNK . "
It 's like being a word that says , " I suppose . "
But it 's really important to say that there 's a very important role in politics of politics , and all of our politicians understand that they have to try to control their language .
For example , until 17 years , the United States won 't be allowed to report the truth that report the truth for the people .
And the fact that it 's all about being because of a bad man , this great name is UNK .
And he 's completely lost from London , and he 's very worried enough to be able to get the courage to get it out , and say he 's going to be able to get the hope out of the room , and then he 's going to be able to get the courage to talk to them , and say , " Well , there 's a lot of security in London , and there 's a lot of security in London , and there 's a lot of security in London , and there 's a lot of security in London , and there 's a lot of security in London , and it 's getting a lot of money to get out and say it for the rest of the world as well as he 's in London .
And just a few years later , we have the first record with the first few words : " UNK . "
A lot of people think that this is from a word called UNK .
No , it 's from a news called UNK .
But to really tell the truth and politics of politics , I want to take you back to the United States in the United States , and I want to go back to the United States .
And then they have a question to tell you about what they call UNK , and their leaders .
They don 't know .
What does it mean to be a community ?
So this problem is going to be very long in Congress .
And there 's been a lot of research , and they 're doing it as well .
I mean , some people want to call up to be the New York City , and some people call him UNK UNK , or other people .
There is no words on the UNK .
Some people just want to say to him .
They think that 's a word that 's been used by the past .
They don 't even have a UNK program , and their business is you can have a fixed chance .
You know , that 's going to be possible .
And every one of them is so sad and tired of it , and that 's true because it 's about three weeks ago .
I read a guy who said , " UNK , " and then it 's going to be the subject . "
And the reason for that is that they don 't have the things that they 're fighting about , and it 's because they 're going to be in front of the church .
You don 't want to hear the UNK of the state .
They don 't want to call him " he 's going to do what he 's going to do in the French . "
So they asked him what they could think that they could think , the lowest , the most terrifying , the most frightening .
This is called " UNK . "
UNK UNK . UNK . They don 't invent the title . I mean , but it 's a meeting , but it 's about a conference .
The same thing to do is something like the UNK UNK .
And it 's not really clear to say " UNK , " " UNK . "
There are a few people who are going to have a small group of marketing , and there 's a lot of people who don 't know , but what it really is , isn 't real stuff .
And it 's also why they 're talking about this bridge .
And they said this is really cool , and you 're not going to be told him .
This guy 's going to go out and meet and meet .
Who 's going to think about him , if he 's just a guy who 's a stupid name like UNK UNK , right ?
And three weeks later , and there 's no UNK .
As a result , they agree with " UNK UNK , " which is , " and not the end of the UNK , and say , " UNK , " which is , " and not the end of the United States , and if you think that 's not the right thing , and we don 't want to be a very good thing , but when we 're not talking about something that 's going to be the same thing , and we don 't want to be a very good thing about the United States , and we don 't want to get a very specific change in the United States , and we 're not going to think of this as a UNK or a UNK , and we don 't want to be a very good thing , and when we look up with this , we 're not going to look up with the idea a little bit about the United States , and we 're not going to think of this as a UNK or a UNK , and we don 't want to be a very good thing to look at
Now , in this case , you can tell the three interesting things .
First of all , my favorite place , before all of the things that I could find , I 'm going to find out how to get the end of the book " UNK . "
UNK UNK once said , " UNK UNK , " right now , it 's just a place that he 's going to die in the center of the church .
And the second thing you can see is that the U.S. government says this is just an ongoing time -- it 's 25 years old .
But the third thing you can tell you , and it 's very important one , and I just want you to remember that part of you , right ?
There are more than 500 of dollars of the bomb on his hands , and there 's the largest economy in the world , and there 's a big problem on the planet , and there 's a big problem on the planet , and there 's a big gap between the world and other kinds of problems .
Now , a lot of this is very expensive to have this thing .
So the last election won 't win .
They get their own body .
And then , the other thing that I 'm talking about is , this guy is very strange -- and he 's never heard of it .
But what 's happening now that you know how many countries there are going to be there ?
UNK .
And it 's because of the way they think , they 're going to look at the same thing that they want to make their own UNK , etc . and so on .
And so at the end , they were told , because no one of them was going to be able to tell the difference of the United States , and they were told that they were going to be honest in the United States , and they were told to tell them that they 're going to fight the federal government in the United States .
And it 's a very important lesson that I think you can learn what you want to leave .
UNK are UNK , and they 're using words and control , but actually , in fact , change the words of words can change the fact that they can change the words of words to change the words .
Thank you very much .
I 'm about 50 of 50 , and I 'm 19 years old , and I 'm 19 years old , and I 'm 19 years old , and I 'm 19 years old , and I 'm 19 years old , and I 'm 19 , and I 'm 19 , and I 'm 19 , and I 'm 19 , and I 'm a woman , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm 19 , and I 'm 19 , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm 19 , and I 'm 19 , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a guy , and I 'm a
I made my UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK , and I couldn 't see a lot of people in Africa , and I couldn 't see a lot of UNK .
This is the first time I went to Afghanistan .
When I first met in war in the war in the middle of the war , in the morning and in the room for the family , and said , " UNK of UNK , " which means UNK and UNK , ' UNK , " and not really what it is to say , " UNK of UNK UNK . "
But that 's what I do .
So today , I 'm here today about Afghanistan in this room , and God , and I 'm talking to my own life , and I 've been talking about nine years old , and I 've been talking about nine years old , and I 've been talking about nine years old , and I 've been doing it all over the last nine years .
In Afghanistan , you can do a great thing with the art , but you know , I don 't think so well , you know , I don 't think so well , you know , I 'm going to figure out how to make sure that I 'm going to figure out how to make sure that I 'm going to try to figure out what 's going on in the world , and that 's why we 're going to be able to figure out what 's going on with the idea that people can be able to figure out what 's going on in the world , and that 's why we 're going to try to figure out what 's going on with the idea that people can be able to figure out what 's going on in the world , and that 's why we 're going to try to figure out what 's going on in the world , and that 's why we can try to figure out what 's going on in the world , and that 's why we can try to figure out what 's going on in the
And I 'd like to tell you a joke about a Christmas child who lived in love with a UNK and a UNK , and I said , " UNK , " and it 's so important to use the UNK and the politics of religion and politics . "
These are the UNK UNK , and I said , " Please , I 'm a UNK , you know , I 'm a UNK . I 'm a hero . "
I 'm trying to figure out the people in the face of these guys who are the ones that are going to become a member of the national heroes .
And I 'd like to tell you a quick example of what this guy 's like to look like in Afghanistan in Afghanistan , and they 're looking for a warning to get out of the streets of the police police care , and they 're not going to ask them to take care of the people who are going to take care of the soldiers who are going to take care of the people who are going to take care of the people who are going to take care of the people who are going to take care of the people who are going to take care of the people who are going to take care of the police care to the people who are not paying attention to the people who are not paying attention to the people who are going to be doing the same thing that 's going to take care of the people who are going to take care of the soldiers who are not talking to us , and say that they 're not going to do the same thing that 's going to take care of the people who are going to be
And I wanted to know how to tell me how to get the situation out of peace in the process of Afghanistan .
And the difference between the war and the environment , and the environment that the environment is , the only way that this is going to work on the ground from the UNK and the environment that it 's going to do is , you know , I 'm going to put out the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK that are all over the place , and then I 'm going to put out the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK that are the ones that lead us to take care of the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK of UNK and UNK UNK to all of them as well .
And I 'd also like to give you a little bit of UNK and UNK , which is UNK to say that in fact , " UNK who are going to take away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are going to get away from the people who are
And yet you might think that if they 're going to be done , they can be understood that they can be understood that they can be understood .
But I 've got to do a little bit of myself , because I want to do it for myself .
That 's me . What do you do ?
Thank you .
Hey , my name is UNK UNK , and I 'm a model .
Actually , this is 10 years ago .
Now , I feel a very uncomfortable feeling of this room , because I don 't wear this shirt .
So , I brought another one .
This is the first time on the TED stage , and I think it 's so exciting to see today today .
If there are some women who don 't want to tell me , I 'm not going to tell you why I 'm going to tell you where I 'm going to tell you about what I 'm going to tell you about UNK .
And I 'm going to tell you how I could be able to tell you about 10 seconds in what I 'm going to tell you .
It 's not something that everyone can do .
It 's not very uncomfortable , and the bad news is that I 'm not going to use them .
The worst news is that I 'm going to take this guy out of the place because you 're going to get me right , and I 'm not going to do whatever I 'm going to do when I 'm wearing my clothes .
UNK !
So , why do I do this ?
This is weird .
You don 't want to look at it like this .
UNK are powerful , but it 's kind of true .
I just made it in six seconds , and it changes the shape of your mind .
I actually found that in this photograph , I don 't have any friends in real life .
When the photographer came up with me , and I was very uncomfortable with this guy when I was so sick .
And the thing about it is that if you don 't have a hand for surgery , or two days ago , we 're doing a good job that we 've done , and we don 't really have to change the other side of our lives , and we don 't really have to change the other side of our lives , and we don 't really have to change the surface of our lives , and we don 't really know what 's going on the face , and that 's what we 've done .
So today , for me , if it 's going to be honest , it 's going to be honest .
And I 'm here today because I 'm a model .
And this is why I 'm in this stage because I 'm a beautiful white woman in our business , and we call this " UNK girl . "
And I 'm going to answer the question that people ask me about these questions , and I ask people to do something very honest .
The first question is , how do you make it ?
And I always said , " I 've been discovered , but that 's not true .
And the truth for me is that I have a very good gene , and I 'm a UNK , and you might ask what it is to solve a problem .
Well , in the past the last few centuries , we don 't just have sex in the last century , and young people , young and UNK are called UNK , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white , white ,
And that 's my legacy . This is what I 've been doing .
I know some of you might have some kind of vision that some of you might be able to tell you about some of the UNK and UNK and UNK and UNK .
Well , first of all , I 'm going to tell you that you 're going to hear about the features that we 're talking about , which is the model that we face to understand how to do this .
But unfortunately , I 've got to tell you that in 2007 , in 2004 , a few hundred people in New York City who worked out in UNK , and they 're not only about 90 percent of them , and they 're not only about 80 percent of them , and it 's just about 70 percent of the population , and there are two people in UNK , and they 're not only 40 percent of them , and they 're not only 40 of them , and they 're not only 40 of them , and they 're not only 40 percent of them , and they 're not only 40 of them , and they 're not only about four percent of them , and they 're not only 40 of them , and they 're not only about four percent of them , and they 're not only 40 percent of them , and they 're not only 40 percent of them , and they 're not only 40 percent of them , and they 're not only 40 percent of them , and it 's not about 90 percent , and it 's
The next question is , what do people ask me ?
My first answer was , " I don 't know , because they don 't let me go to . "
But the second answer , which is the answer that I want to ask to ask , " Why ? "
You know what ? You can choose anything to do anything .
You could be the president of the United States or the next generation of the Internet , or the people who are in the center , because they 're the first ones .
And if you can tell the truth , they 're like , " No , no , I want to say , " I said , " My boss . "
Because I can 't solve anything you can become a UNK or an UNK , or a UNK , or a UNK .
When you think about it , you 're like , you know , you 're like , you know , you 're like , you know , you 're like , you know , say you 're going to win the end .
UNK is not going to be part of you , but it 's pretty good , but it 's not a great business .
And I 'm going to show you what I 'm going to tell you about 10 years of years , because it 's not as if it 's just a UNK UNK .
So if the photographer is right here -- at the same time -- like the UNK UNK , which says , " UNK , I want to take a look at the end of this arm , and I want to take a look at the end of the road , and I 'm going to go up to the end of the road , and then he 's going to go up and down , and you 're going to get a look at the end of the road , and then it 's going to go down and down , and you 're going to get a look at the end side of the car that you 're thinking about , and then it 's going to go down and down , and you 're going to get a look at the end of the road , and then it 's going to go down and down , and you 're going to get a look at the end of the car that you 're thinking about , and it 's going to go down and down , and you 're going to get a look at the
And this looks like this .
I don 't want it so much .
I don 't know how it works .
And the thing is , if you 've got a little bit of work done , you 're going to do something else you do , and if you think about it , you 've got to say something out in the last 10 years , and if you think you want to be the president of the United States , and you say , " You want to be an American , but if you think you want to be the president of the United States , and if you think you want to be the president of the United States , and you 're going to see if you want to be an American , but if you think you want to be an American , but if you think you want to be the president of the United States , and you 're going to see if you want to be an American , but if you think you want to be an American , but if you think you want to be the president of the United States , and you 're going to see if you want to be an American , but if you
The next question is , " Are they going to work ? "
Yeah , they can do all the photos , but that 's just a small part of the work .
And this is my first picture , and it 's my first time , and I don 't even have it .
I know that 's a little bit of a lot of people , and I 'm so old and I 'm young too much .
This is the photograph of a couple of years ago .
This is a photograph of me .
My friend was with me .
And this is a photograph I did not know of a few days ago when I was in my Ph.D. , and a couple of years ago .
This is the picture of my project and a magazine .
This is now what I 'm doing today .
I want you to understand that these are not my own pictures .
You know , with a group of young people who made a UNK , their engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , the engineers , they built these pictures , not me .
The next question is " Do you get free ? "
I do so many of the UNK that I never had to do with this time that I 'm not going to get out of the work that I 'm not going to get out of my life , but that is something that I don 't really care about , and that 's what we don 't want to get in real life . And that 's what we don 't want to get in real life . And that 's what we don 't want to get in real life .
And I went to a restaurant in Cambridge , and I went to a restaurant and I forgot a lot of money and they gave me a pair of pants .
When I was a child , I went to my friend , and she was a bad product , and I said , " UNK , we 're going to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to get a step on the road . "
I got this because of my face , not my identity , and some people who work on the other side of their lives .
I lived in New York , and I was there in New York City and a half of young people in the year , and they 're about 80 percent of the boys in the world are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who are young people who
And in New York City , it 's about 70 million people in New York , and they say , " Am I going to stop ? "
" Should I do it for a long time ? When did it be time ? "
And I was there to study that in the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States , and they 're about 70 percent of their body .
So the last question is " How does it work ? "
I guess the answer to them is , " If you lose a little bit , you 're going to be happy , and you 're happy enough to believe . "
And at the end of the day , we 'll give a similar idea like this .
And we said , " You can get away and creative , passionate , UNK , UNK , a great job . "
Not so that it 's just a half , because we 're never going to look at the camera , and I never say , " I don 't have any time . "
Because I have to worry how to it .
If you ever think that if my foot is better , it 's going to be better , and I 'm going to go even further .
You 're going to look at the microscope because they 've got the most UNK , and the cool hair , and they 're probably the most likely you have in the world , and they 're probably the best women in the world , and they 're probably the best women in the world , and they 're probably the best women in the world , and they 're probably the best women in the world , and they 're probably the best women in the world .
So when I was asked to do this for a moment , it was hard to find a balance , because if I 'm here , I 'm not going to be able to tell you why I 'm not going to get the rest of my life and say , " No , I 'm not going to do anything that 's going to get out of my life , and say , " Oh , that 's what I 'm going to do now , " which means that I 'm not going to get the rest of the life that 's going to do something that 's going to happen to me now , " and I 'm not going to get the rest of the rest of my life and say , " Hey , I 'm not going to get the rest of my life , and say , " Look , I 'm not going to be able to get into the rest of the life , and say , " Look , I 'm not going to be able to get into the rest of the life , and say , " Look
But the hardest part of this is that people who are the ones that don 't care about the UNK , because my own body is the greatest benefit of ourselves .
But at the same time that I was happy and worried about what I 'm doing , and I 'm not working in the last 10 or 30 years , because of all of the things that I could not be able to do in the first 10 , 20 or 30 years , because of all of the things that I could not be able to do in the last 10 or 30 years , because of all of the things that I could not be able to do in the last 10 or 30 years , because of all of the things that I could not be able to do in the last 10 or 30 years , because of all of the things that I could not be able to do in the last 10 or 30 years , because of all of the things that I could not be able to do in the last 10 or 30 years , because of all of the things that I could not be able to do in the last 10 or 30 years , because of all of the things that I could not be able to do
If it 's going to help you to do that , I hope that we can all be able to express the processes that we 're able to see , and why we understand what we 're doing , and what we do to understand .
Thank you .
Today , I 'm going to ask one thing .
Don 't say I was normal .
I want to tell you about my two brothers .
And he 's 23 years old and 25 years old .
And he said , " You know , I can tell you a lot of fun with his own . "
UNK knows what it is .
He can 't leave his life together .
He doesn 't care about it ; you don 't care what people are .
He doesn 't have the difference between religion , and he never said no .
When he 's singing our singing singing , he forgot to forget that I forgot a lot about what we know , and that 's what we know about it , and that 's what we know .
UNK is 16 years old today , and it 's too late .
And he 's got a lot of memory .
But that memory is a selection .
He couldn 't remember my chocolate , but remember my UNK , who was four years old , and we were talking about the first time in my arm 's birthday , and we were talking about the fact that my arm was the first time in my arm 's birthday , and we were talking about the fact that my arm was the first time in my hands , and we were talking about the fact that my arm was the first time in my arm 's life , and he said , " Oh my God 's birthday , and it 's up to me on the morning , and we 're talking a little bit later at the end of my arm 's Day , and we 're talking a little bit later at the end of my arm 's Day , and we 're talking a little bit later at the end of my arm 's Day , and we 're talking a little bit later at the end of my arm 's Day , and we 're talking a little bit later at the end of my arm , and we 're talking about the
Sound so amazing ?
But a lot of people don 't think that much .
And the truth is , because of their minds that they don 't have sex , they 're always alone , they 're all wrong .
But what I really want to believe is that if you don 't think that the fact is that they don 't know that they 're very popular , and they 're so extraordinary that they 're all wrong , but they 're so extraordinary that we have autism , but we can 't tell you how to do it , but it 's very special that we have autism , but we 're so familiar with people , but they 're all different of them .
Some of you may not really understand the term " UNK , " which is a complex brain for complex brain , and it 's very effective in the brain that it 's so complex .
Every patient 's disease is special , and they 're all different of them .
And in all of the world , every 20 minutes , there 's a new virus about HIV / AIDS , and yet , that 's the fastest epidemic in the world , and yet we don 't know that this is about the disease and the treatment .
And I remember the first time that I remember that " We don 't know what I 'm going to do with " The UNK " and I don 't know what 's going to do about " War . "
When I was three years old , my brother was born , and I was very excited about my new family .
And a few months later , I realized that he was a little different than a few months later .
He 's very UNK .
And he doesn 't want to be like a kid that he does not have fun with me , and he doesn 't really care about it .
And UNK put his own world , and he 's going to use his own strategy to look up with his hand , and he 's going to get a lot of fun to him , and he 's in his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to get a job out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and he 's going to put his hand out of his hand , and
And when he 's older , he 's more UNK than these special places .
But even though it 's common to have sex , depression and loss , and there 's something special about it , and that 's what he 's going to be like , and we 're not going to see people in the world , and we 're not going to see the world that he 's going to die from , and he 's going to meet the world that he 's going to die from .
It 's easy .
I 'm not going to have a hard time to tell you about what I 'm doing .
But I kept thinking about the things that I 'm telling you about , in a sense , with respect and love that I don 't want to do , and I don 't really want to say that " normal " is " right . "
It 's just as part of the people who don 't care about the bad thing that people don 't want to represent .
It 's just saying , " There are different species .
And I just want to say a word about UNK UNK to you , you 're not going to have to say that " normal . "
You can be extraordinary .
Whether the difference is whether we have sex , and we all have people who are all different from each other , and then we 're all born with this guy who 's going to be completely blind of all of us .
And the more you think , the more likely you want to do with someone who 's going to do with someone who 's going on with someone who 's going on with someone who 's going on with him is that he 's going to be the same thing for everyone who 's going to think about it .
Please don 't say " normal . "
Thank you .
There 's a guy on the UNK , and it 's just a little bit of an UNK , and it 's just a half of a half of it .
But now 50 years later , we can do it a little more than a million times , and that 's not only about 100 million of them , or 100 billion of them .
And I 'm going to show you a new kind of technology technology called UNK , which is a technology that can be so used to the speed of light .
So with this technology , we can see the camera that we can see in the context of the eye , and we don 't know that we don 't know how we 're going to look at the camera , and we don 't know what we 're doing with a camera .
Now , if I take a pencil with a laser , and a half of them in a trillion and a half of them -- and it 's just a few times a few times , and it 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a lot of light , and there 's a
Now , what if you put this cup , these lights in the glass of the glass ?
What does it look like to slow down ?
Now , there 's a whole thing .
Now , please , please remember that this is really what happened in a second week -- and that 's what I 'm going to try to get back to the end of the week , but now I 'm going to take a look at the speed of the movement for you to see a million times of the movement that you can see on the stage .
But Coke is not yet .
Now , there are a lot of things going on here , so let me just give you a couple of them .
Right now , you can get into the wall , and we 're the ones that we put in the wall , and it 's on the inside .
Some of them came out , and the table on the table , you start looking at these UNK .
Most of the light ended up with the UNK and the four weeks .
And you can see , there 's an empty bubble , and it 's in the middle .
At the same time , with the table on the table , and because in the top of the top , you can see that on the top of the wall , you can see the UNK and the UNK .
Now , if you take a look at the level of the camera , and do the same thing , you need a million times , you know , how long is you need to take a long time to see the process ?
One day , a week ? Actually , it 's a year .
And it 's a little bit boring , a kind of a UNK device that 's going to play .
But what do you look like there 's some dark thing ?
You can see the UNK in front of the table , and the background are white and walls .
This is like a rock in the water .
And I think that 's how we evolved to create a UNK , and we 're seeing a few seconds a few seconds later , but of course our eyes are going to look at the shape that we see .
But if you look at something like this red , you notice that it 's just as if it 's gone in the white red , and it 's just not balanced . It 's not a dark ; it 's not so cool .
Why ? Because the UNK , and the UNK are just a few , and a half billion of them .
So , in the future , you get a camera on the camera , you can go to the supermarket , and you can check the water on the water .
So , what are the team of the UNK in MIT ?
Now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to do a little bit easier , you 're a little bit easier , but we need to be able to do it less than less than just a short time .
So what we do is , we put these lights together , and we put a lot of them every time , every single time , every single time , every single time you saw a look at it , and we 're seeing a picture that you 've seen before .
And we 're going to have all of the data that 's going on in the past , and it 's a lot of fun work .
Now , people can fly .
A couple of other heroes can do it , but think about the future of the future ; he can see what he 's going on .
And that 's why we can put them up into the door .
And these lights go into the room , and they go back into the door , and then we can use these light lines .
It 's not science . That 's what we really did .
On the left-hand side you see our airplane .
There 's a human brain , and we 're going to get a light on the wall .
So , in our own culture , it 's called UNK , and it 's based on nature , and then they created this drawing .
So we 're going to get into these slides , and they 're going to hit the wall out , and they 're going to spread into the cell , and if it 's going to go out , there 's a little bit of a conversation that 's going to go to the point that we 're going to go back to the other side of the world , and that 's what they 're going to go back to the other side of time , and that 's what they 're going to go back to the other side of time , and that 's what they 're going to go back to the other side of time , and that 's what they 're going to go back to the other side of time , and that 's what they 're going to go back in a different time .
And because we have an opportunity that works very fast , and it 's just a little bit of a specific chance , and that 's the kind of thing that we have .
It has a good time , and it can fly around the world .
So we don 't really know the distance of the room , but we don 't know what 's going to get out of it , but we don 't know what it is that way to go .
So with laser , we 're able to figure out the original picture , and you can see a lot of them in the screen , and then we can see the surface , right ?
Can we express it ?
That 's our model .
So now we 're looking for a little bit of a road , but in the future , we can actually see the technology on the ground , and we can actually see the UNK , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see the heart of the window , and we can see
But of course , because of all of the organizations and the water that are so difficult , so let 's just say this technology is really clear , and we 're going to think of this as a modern health problem .
Now , as a scientist , as a scientist , as a scientist , science became the art of science , and a lot of them , and I realize that the process that we 're able to do is , in fact , a new kind of technology , and we 're seeing a new amount of technology , and we 're seeing a new amount of technology , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and it 's a little bit of a billion years ago , and that 's the kind of thing that we 've
But there 's a lot of fun to happen .
When you look at these UNK , they 're all going away .
But these UNK should be able to move .
What 's going on ?
And it turns out that because we 're moving around them to these things , we have a strange phenomenon that Einstein would be really happy to see these pictures .
And the rest of the things that happens in the camera , it 's time and it 's time , so through time and space and space , we can build that curve .
So if you look at the table , again for the next generation , the next generation of the technology , the generations that we are , and we 're going to use all of our data , we 're not going to use all of our data , and we 're going to tell you how to do it , and we 're going to use all of this kind of data that we 're going to tell you , and we 're going to go out of all of our data , we 're going to tell you how to do it again , and that 's what we 're doing , and we 're going to use all of our data , and we 're going to tell you about what we 're doing , and we 're going to use all of this kind of data that we 're going to tell you about , and we 're going to use all of this kind of data that we 're going to tell you , and we 're going to go out of all of our data , we 're going to tell you how to
UNK is too bad . Thank you .
This is the place that I lived , and Kenya , in the South Bronx , the South Bronx .
In my home my father was my father 's grandmother , and it 's from the National Park .
UNK , the South Bronx in the South Bronx , doesn 't get it as a result as a result of such wild animals that have been used to fly around the park .
So as a result like lions are eating , and that 's what they 're doing .
They killed our families .
And this is one of the women who 's been killed in the morning , and I 've seen a lot of people in the morning , and it 's already dead , because it 's the only one in my family .
We were talking to our UNK , and we brought it into our animals and our homes from heaven and live , and that 's why we really are looking for them .
So , I became very tired of UNK .
UNK are all the UNK , and they protect us and our families , but they do a lot of problems with this problem .
So they decided to kill these lions .
This is one of the six lions in Florida , and one of them is one of these UNK lions .
And I think this is how it was there .
In our home , it 's about our family 's death -- the age of the age are waiting for lunch , and the same thing that happened to me , is that the same thing that happens to me , the same thing is going to be the same thing that the parents have in me , and the same thing that happen to me is the same thing that happened to me , and the other thing that happened to me , is that the same thing that happened in my own grandmother , was the same thing that happened to me , and the other thing that happened to me , and the other thing that happened to me , is that the same thing that happened in my own grandmother , was the same thing that happened to me , and the other thing that happened to me , and the other thing that happened to me , is that the same thing that happened in my own grandmother , was the same thing that happened to me , and the other thing that happened to me , and the other thing that happened to me
So I had to find a solution problem .
And the first way I thought of it was using fire , because I knew that lions were afraid of fear .
But I realized that it 's not so good that there 's not a thing that 's going to do well , and then we can 't do it with lions .
But I 'm not doing anything , and I 'm not UNK .
So there 's the second thing : UNK .
And I wanted to get some UNK off the way that I was sitting in a UNK .
But lions are smart .
They saw the first day the first day , and they went back , but the next day , and he said , " This thing 's going to be gone .
So they come around , and they die .
And one night , I went to the bathroom , and it wasn 't there that day , they weren 't .
I started to realize that lions were afraid of UNK .
So , there was an idea .
Because when I was a child , I could tell you that I could not do it every day with my family , and every day that day , I could say that I 'm going to do the same thing in my mother 's house , and that 's what I learned to do in my mother 's house , and then I learned a lot about what my mom could have , and I learned a lot about what my mom could have , and I learned a lot about what my mom could have .
So I found an old car , and I found it a UNK , which is a device that 's going to run out of the car , and it 's a little bit of driving up of the car .
And then , I found a whole thing about how to control the light .
UNK from a bad cup of water .
It 's all ready .
And as you can see , as you can see here , you can see solar cells with solar cells , and they provide the tools to give me an example of what I call " UNK . "
And it 's not going to be able to fold the light up .
You can see that the electricity bulb is no longer , because the lions are coming from there .
When you look at the beach at the time , you see it .
And the light on the lights is going to be able to get killed by the lion , and they 're going to walk around the ground , and actually , in fact , actually , I 'm actually on my bed on my bed , and actually , at the end of the day , I 'm on my bed and right now , and actually , again , I 'm on my bed and I 'm on my bed .
Thank you .
And I ended up two years ago in my hands , and since then , we didn 't have any UNK in our lungs .
My neighbors had heard this way .
One of them is this guy .
She 's got a big UNK in lions . She asked me if I could help her hand in my home .
And I agree with this .
I took the lights on the back , and you can see , these are the UNK .
You know , I 'm going to do this in a family in our family , and they 're very useful for the rest of our family .
Right now , my approach is to say all of the people in Kenya are going to use the rest of the others that have been used to eat other animals , like dogs , Americans , Americans , who are being used to get human beings that are used to survive .
And I was very lucky because it was the most popular school in Kenya , and this is the best school in Kenya , and I 've been very excited about this .
And my new school is now coming up , and help me to pay attention and get more money .
And I even put my friends back to my community , and I helped care that they were not there , and I teach them how to do it .
A year ago , I was just a fan of UNK UNK , and I often looked at the speed of a child , and I said to him , " This is a day , I 'm going to be here in my day , and I 'm going to be here in the middle , and I 'm going to be here in the middle , and I 'm going to go in the room for a moment .
Today , I do it .
I got the airplane . This is my first time .
So my great dream is that when I grew up , I was a UNK engineer .
I used to talk about lions , but now it 's because of my invention , because my grandfather has saved my father and our lions and we 're going to die as well .
Thank you so much . So in my language , it says : Thank you so much .
You can 't believe that you can 't believe how many of you are .
So you 've got this prize . UNK UNK : Yes .
Are you so doing another software ?
What do you want to do next ?
DH : I came up with a demonstration that I wanted to do a UNK .
UE : I know I know there are , but I just wanted to do my own .
DH : You 've tried to do it again , right , but you 're like , " I 've done a lot of it , but I stop doing it because it 's so scared .
It 's going to be a war . UNK UNK , you 're different .
We 're going to take you in the middle of the growth and the friends .
Thank you . DH : Thank you .
I lived in Los Angeles .
This is the New York City : UNK , UNK , UNK .
So the marketing of the city , and they 're sitting there talking to tell the story of the city of the South Bronx , and they 're going to figure out what is going on in the city , and they 're going to figure out what it is like to get the city of this city .
This is the South Bronx .
UNK , UNK , UNK .
And two hundred million Americans that live , and I lived in food , and New York City , where they don 't pay the cars to get care of traffic care and take care of the cars .
The interesting thing is that it 's much more people than you want to get killed .
On the South Bronx , where people are dying disorders .
So for example , the obesity rate that I lived in my neighborhood are more than 20 percent of the streets that we have today , and perhaps eight times more than the mountain in UNK .
I 'm tired of this .
And I 'm thinking , well , if you don 't have the ability to get healthy food , what do you think that every time you get from home , you 've got to look up in the food that you have in your community ?
I saw it in the chair , and I saw it .
I was able to see how it works like this .
I don 't think so .
I think the answer is the problem .
UNK is the problem , food is a solution .
And I just hated it to about 45 minutes , and then I 'm not going to buy the Apple 's apple .
So what I did was , in my house , I was living in my house .
It 's called the green chain for the park .
It 's about 10 feet tall .
UNK the government of the government .
But something needed to be someone who wanted it .
So I thought , " That 's good ! This is my responsibility , and I 've got to manage it , and what I wanted to do to do what I wanted to do . "
And this is why I 'm going to take this thing .
So my team and my team , " UNK UNK , we 're beginning to start to grow our food forest , and we have a whole nine percent of them .
We 're a free organization , from different cities , different UNK , all of us are volunteers , and we 're doing all of it .
UNK are beautiful .
But it 's pretty good to remember .
And the government decided to convince me to give me a message that I had to lose my garden , and I put a warning in my home .
And I was like , " What 's it ? "
Just stop in a small place on top of the water that doesn 't really care ?
And then I thought , " UNK , that 's it . "
Because it doesn 't happen .
So when the New York Times , James UNK wrote about his story about his story and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK , and we made it to do something called UNK , and we made it !
And we use our hands .
And they even started to come up and say how he was happy and love to what we did .
I mean , of course , how can they do that ?
UNK , the UNK in New York City , in the U.S.
It has about 26 square kilometers .
That 's 200 of them .
It 's enough to grow up to about two million of them in the space for about two million tons of water .
Why do they feel so bad ?
There are thousands of trees to get thousands of them , and one million of them .
A price of money can get you about 15 dollars of 50 dollars .
And this is my belief , and I 'm telling people that have food on your own food .
UNK food is like you 're getting away by the year .
So , in Los Angeles , I have a problem .
I was there and I was there and I was there .
I would never be as part of myself as part of myself as a real part of myself that I made myself to create my own reality .
You see , I 'm an artist .
UNK are my UNK , and I 've created my own art .
It 's as if the artists 's , they 're like UNK , and I 'm like , " UNK , green , UNK . "
I brought myself from a garden and with a UNK , and plants and trees and trees are the ones that I did .
You might be able to figure out what the hell you can do , if you think of it as being your drawing .
You can 't imagine how powerful it is , and how it 's going to survive .
What 's going to happen ?
I saw my job became an educational tool for my community , became the tools for my community .
To change the community , you have to change the soil .
We are the soil .
You would be surprised by how the kids are affected .
UNK is the most powerful thing about living health health care , especially , especially in the center of the city .
You can also pick UNK .
And I remember a mother , a mom and a half of a half of a half of my life , and when I saw it , they saw it very hard to me .
And one of the things that I felt so bad about , and I told them , you don 't like to eat food .
This is the problem in the streets .
And when I saw the people in my neighborhood were hungry , it made me feel embarrassed , and I said , " UNK , you don 't want people to pay for your food ? "
And I said , " Of course not , I 'm not afraid that people are going to get it .
And this is why it 's on the street .
That 's what I wanted .
I wanted people to walk it , but when I was happy , I wanted to be able to improve the body of health . "
And one day , when I was one of the UNK in Los Angeles I went to a garden .
And the little guy helped me UNK .
It 's so cool , so they share about how they value and how they grow their children and their mothers to live their own lives , just to tell them , just to do this .
The green structure has probably been 20 kilometers .
We 've got about 50 of people on our team , and they 're all volunteers .
If kids get a UNK , the kids will get the blue blue .
If they do it , they 'll eat it .
But when they don 't show any child , if they don 't have the idea of food and body , they 're just blind enough of the food they have on their lives .
I saw young people who wanted to work , but they were happy that I saw a lot of different people , and they don 't know how to do it , and they don 't know what they 're doing , and they don 't know what they want to do .
And when I was growing up , I found a chance that we could train these kids to develop their lives , and we have a sustainable life of life .
When we do that , we know we can .
UNK to the next name .
But if we don 't change the structure of the soil , we never do it .
This is one of my projects . This is what I wanted to do .
I wanted to have a whole neighborhood in the neighborhood of the neighborhood in this neighborhood where people were able to share food .
I 'd like to put the tissue into a healthy coffee .
UNK .
I don 't want to be free , because the consumer is inevitable .
There is an awful thing that 's happening over the place you 've got to get it .
So what I 'm talking about here is that people get better enough , and let 's see the streets from the streets , and the people who are doing the food that they have , and they 've taken away from their own food , it 's open , and it 's open , and it 's open food .
So what I 'd like to do is to figure out the project of this project .
I wanted us to become a UNK , UNK and UNK .
We 're going to change the definition .
If you 're not a UNK , then you 're not a UNK .
So , what do you take your pick up to the point ?
UNK is to be able to choose your choice .
And basically basically , if you want to meet me , if you want to meet , if you want to sit in the chair of the chair , there are some people who don 't have to call me a hand .
And if you want to see if I 'm going to get a UNK here , so we can get a little bit of something .
UNK , thank you .
Thank you .
I 've seen a week in 2011 , and it 's New York City .
We can 't get rid of it , like death .
And we 're sitting in the dark , and we 're not sitting in the dark room , and they don 't have a window room , and they 're not going to fly the sun , they 're going to fly the sun .
We use the UNK tools to become the perfect UNK , and we 're not able to get the perfect ones that can 't happen , and we 're always going to be able to get a part of the book , and we 're all about media , and we 're all used to , you know , just by being a media , and we 're all used to , you know , just by being a media , and we 're used to draw images , and we 're all used to , and you know , as a result , and we 're used to draw images and images .
In January of 2011 , just like the rest of us , I saw the tragedy in my house .
So , as soon as I got to work on a team called " The UNK UNK " ] , and it 's just a few days , it 's just a few days .
I 'm not aware of other people who don 't really understand that we can do it in our hands , and so I decided to put them into their projects , and I decided to put them into their children .
So in August of May , I went to Japan .
This is a small village in Japan , and it 's about five million people in Japan .
There were two UNK in the middle of the tsunami , and there were two places in the ground .
You can imagine that the town has to hurt .
We 're building the UNK and the water in the water .
We 're helping schools and the UNK houses , and they 're UNK and UNK and UNK .
We understood a lot of UNK , UNK UNK , and these fish are local factories , UNK fish .
We become the opposite , but we 're very excited about it .
For a couple of weeks , all the volunteers and the local ones , there are some sort of things like this .
They can look at the pictures , the cameras , the UNK and the UNK .
And everybody 's going to be able to make a difference .
They took these pictures and everything , and they brought them out into town .
And it 's still now that I realize that these pictures are not going to be part of those of you who lose the ones that are missing .
When they get infected from the tsunami , you know , well , there 's four UNK , looking for the rest of the world , and if you 're talking about something , everything that 's going to be around the rest of the brain , it 's going to be around the rest of the world , and all of the things that they 're going to tell you that they are all going to have a whole body on the other side of everything .
I was in the morning of Japan , and I discovered that I was living a UNK center .
There 's a huge amount of UNK to the UNK community .
And then it 's good enough to get people to get the ones that are getting away from the ground .
People took the pictures up to the public level , and I was very fortunate to get their trust , and I was able to figure out , and I was able to figure out , and I was able to figure out , and I was going to get some of them , and I was able to figure out , and I was able to figure out , and I 'm going to get the ones , and I 'm going to get some of them , and I 'm going to get some of them , and I 'm going to get some of them , and I 'm going to get some of them , and I 'm going to get some of them .
And it 's as exciting as these moments as happiness , and I tell people that if you hear people , you know , " innovation . " And that 's what I really did , and that 's what I actually did to call " innovation . "
When I look at the pictures , there were even a few years ago , and there were people who were still involved in the lab , and maybe I was able to figure out these pictures of people who could actually be able to figure out these pictures of people who could not be able to figure out what they could do with a UNK , or maybe I could help figure out what they could do , and maybe I could help these pictures that I could not be able to get out of these photographs , and maybe they could actually figure out these photos of people who could actually be able to figure out what they could do with a UNK , or maybe I could help figure out what they could do , and maybe I could help them to figure out what they could do with a UNK , or maybe I could help figure out the pictures that they could not be able to get out of these photographs , and maybe they could not be able to figure out what they could do with an engineer , or maybe I could help
So , when I was a child , I went to a UNK and I asked some UNK , and I didn 't get a lot of attention to talk about the morning , and I knew that we should act .
And so we started to get into it .
This is the first shot of it .
Now , it 's not about being bad enough to lose the face , but there 's no way of food that 's going out there , and we 're so bad about it , and we 're not going to be able to do a great job of this .
Otherwise , a girl 's face doesn 't look like her face -- and the tragedy of the tragedy , and it 's just as if they 're UNK .
As a result of time , again , more and more of the pictures that are going to be done , and we need to be able to pay attention with 12 different countries , and then we 're going to run out from 12 different countries , and they 're from 12 different countries , and they 're from 12 different countries .
And two weeks ago , I was 15 of 15 volunteers , and they were willing to join us .
And only in Japan , in Japan , we 've created a lot of different places that we 've built , and we 've got some of those UNK in the city , and they 're spread to the United States , and they 're all over the schools , and they 're all over the world .
Every week , we all started using a museum inside of weeks , and people were going to spread their photos back in time .
Sometimes a few years old women have never seen their eyes , and before they get a photo of autism , they 're going to be able to figure out the surface , and then there are a number of weeks , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out , and they 're going to be able to figure out the surface , and then
And yet , by the way , they 're going to go back to these pictures of the time , and of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of the treatment .
Maybe a few hours can be done , and maybe it 's going to be around a couple weeks .
And a few months later .
And the beautiful and the UNK are , of course , to be able to figure out what to do , or make a difference , or a little bit of color , and let 's get the color out of the place that doesn 't get a lot of damage .
It 's very expensive for a long time .
So all of the UNK that I 've seen is that we 've made out of the surface of the ocean , and it 's gone down , and there 's a lot of water , and there 's not a lot of land , and there 's a lot of land , and there 's not a lot of land , and there 's a lot of land , and there 's not a lot of land , and there 's a lot of land , and there 's not a lot of UNK , and there 's a lot of UNK , and there 's not a lot of land , and there 's a lot of land , and there 's not a lot of UNK , and there 's not a whole lot of water , and there 's not a lot of UNK , and there 's a lot of UNK , and there 's not a lot of land , and there 's a lot of UNK , and there 's not a lot of land , and there 's a lot of UNK , and there 's a lot of UNK , and
And if these pictures don 't have to clean clean , we don 't do it , they 've got to do it , they 've got to do it .
Our hand is very UNK .
When there 's a woman 's up to us , we get rid of it .
These pictures are so easy to UNK .
As a result of my team , I said that it 's like someone 's been UNK .
You can 't lose it . There 's a mess .
For those of us who are these pictures are really lucky , and these are all these pictures .
She 's starting to look at her own hands , and she knows that she 's actually made more damage to their own .
Oh , she has a picture .
Otherwise , photograph , and her son , her face , has completely been able to do so well , and then we could get all of those pieces of photographs , and then we could bring all the photos together .
And when she came to his photograph , she was sharing a little bit of a few weeks later .
Her pictures are really designed by her husband , where they come out of the ground , and they 're all very sure very much , and they 're able to tell him .
And at the end of the tsunami that he was doing , he 's going to fight the UNK and the destruction of the environment .
And at the end of the UNK , he 's not going to face the front line .
And her two sons , and there are so many different ones , and there are still in two different schools .
One of the kids in the world were attacked by the tsunami .
She took the whole week and went back and walked out , and they were dead .
We were going to give him a picture of her son , and she 's a little son of her son 's son .
And to her , as a result of depression , these pictures are going to give him the best of his son , but not so much of his time to leave his life , and say that there are just three months of his life that 's coming out of his life , and it 's not going to be able to get his eyes to change the world , and that 's not the end of his life , and that 's not the end of his life , and that 's not from the end of his life , and that 's not the end of his life , and that 's not from the end of his life , and that 's not from the end of his life , and that 's not from the end of his life , and that 's not the end of his life , and that 's not from the end of his life , and that 's not from the end of his life , and that 's not from the end of his life , and that 's not from the end of his life , and
And in Japan , six months later , " UNK , " which is 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , hundreds of them , and hundreds of thousands of children are going to be able to do more than that .
And most of them go back to the blind hand , which is important .
There are more than 500 volunteers in the United States , and we 're going to go back to 90 percent of these photos , and these are the images that we 've never seen .
At this point , we don 't have a device that 's used for a factory , or a lot of them .
We were cameras .
So , a photograph is a reminder and a promise to us , and to remind us , some of them , some of them , a lot of love , a lot of love .
They help us to remember , all of our past , and we 've seen a lot of our time before , and we 're thinking about what we 're thinking about , but we 're thinking about the first thing that we want to find out of the day , and we 're thinking about the first one that we want to find out of the day , and we 're thinking about the first time you want to get back to the first time you want to get something left .
And this is the part of this project , to try to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than a person who 's been involved in the past .
And as a result of this photo , it 's going to go back to the person 's face , and it 's going to be different from what 's going to get you in the face , and it 's a lot of different kinds of lives .
This project became a big deal for us .
For some of the lessons that I 've made , I think , they 've created a few of these things , and if they can do it , they can 't use the specific features of the brain , and if they don 't have the same thing , they don 't just have the ones who are using the UNK , and for all of them , and for the simple people in the world , just for the very specific people .
I 'd like to read to you now that I 'm going to read you to give me a piece of email , and I 'm going to get one of them , from the end of the day and from the day after the end of the day .
" When I 'm doing these pictures , I don 't want to get all of those of you guys in this photograph .
In particular , as many of you who have young people who are young people who are young people who are young people , who are the ones that go to school , and then there 's a little boy , and my wife , who are born with me , and my son , who are born with me , and my son , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are born with me , and my wife , who are the ones that
There are the world and there 's more fundamental things about what we need , and we have some basic need to do it , right ? "
Thank you .
Today , I want to tell you a quick question about this problem , and it 's a problem that 's so different .
What I 'm talking about is the secret of food that I 'm talking about , and I 'm going to ask questions , and everyone 's asking everybody , " Why is she ? "
" How do you want to get a person with a person with a man ? "
I 'm not talking of the health care , social workers , not the experts in the state .
I 'm just a woman who 's a father who 's going to tell you .
I was 22 years old from Harvard .
I moved to New York City , and I started my first job in " UNK , " " UNK and UNK . "
When I first came up with my own house , I had a first card card card . I had a very big secrets .
And this is a secret that one of my favorites that I think this is a guy who is so UNK on my body , too much more , too much , too much .
And the one that I like to tell you that I 've ever seen my head on the dog to kill me , and the threat is to kill me , and I 'm so sure that I 've always had to do more time than I 've been doing so many times .
Now , one of the things that I 'm talking about is called " UNK , " which is one of the things that have happened because there are millions of people who are going to die in every year , and they 're going to be a million women in every year .
Maybe it 's happening in your body .
I don 't look like it as a typical state of violence .
I had a UNK UNK , and I got a UNK from the UNK .
I 'm going to spend most of the time working in " UNK , " UNK , UNK , UNK and Washington .
And I said to my second child for 20 years and have three children .
I raised a black UNK , and I built a UNK UNK .
And that 's the first thing that I 'm going to tell you about the first thing : Your violence could have nothing to do with every person , in a way that you can 't tell the world you 're about to share with you , trust , income and education .
It 's everywhere .
The second thing that I 'm going to say is , that many people think that there is a lot of people who are going to have sex in women , which should have be a problem .
It 's not .
It 's about 80 percent of the people who are the ones who are the ones that have ever seen before , and what we 're trying to do is , say , as a result in the family , and that 's what we 're talking about , and that 's the reason why your family is talking about , and that 's what we 're going to see today , is that we don 't want to get a sense of fear , and that 's the reason why the family is , and it 's the reason that we want to get a sense of violence , and that 's the reason why the family is , and that 's the reason why our family is talking about , and that 's what we 're talking about , and that 's the reason why your family is talking about , and that 's what we 're going to see in the room , and that 's what we 're talking about , and that 's the reason why your family is talking about , and that 's what we 're going to see today , is that
I was just as a guy who spent me in the world who kept me in a place , but actually , actually , actually , actually , in my age , a very common thing .
When I was 22 years old , and in the United States in the United States in the United States , in the United States , in the United States , women are more likely to get Alzheimer 's disease , and women are the ones that have more than 50 women in the United States , and women who have more than 50 women in the United States , and women who have more than 50 women in the United States , and women who are in the United States , who are more than 50 women in the United States , and women who are in the United States , who are more than 50 women in the United States , and women who are in the United States , and women who are in the United States , and women are more likely to get Alzheimer 's disease , or women 's children who are in the United States , and women who are more than 50 women in the United States , and women who are in the United States , who are more than 50 women in the United States , and women who are
I 'm a very typical victim , because I don 't know how to do it .
I met in a UNK , and I was a month , and I was a month , and it was cold .
We sat in New York in New York City , and he 's talking to me .
And he told me two things .
And the first thing is that he 's too busy with UNK and they 're working on a very good bank .
But for the first time to give me the most visible to me is his intelligence and humor , and he looks like a lot of them .
His face was like the UNK on the UNK , and it looks like people who love it .
And the most powerful thing about the time that I 'm going to do in the end is , you know , in this sense , I 'm a very powerful part of this feeling .
When I was just the end of the time , he made me feel like he was the dog .
And we started talking to him , and he liked everything about everything , and for my smart , I gave young women in Harvard , and my job .
He wanted to know about my family , my family , my childhood , my wish and dreams .
UNK to me , I was as a woman and an old man never had ever been there .
You know , he 's not going to tell him about his secrets , and he said , " He 's so sick in his life , and he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he said , " he was so young to him , and he told me that he was very young in the age of his life , and he told me that he was very young in the age of his life , and he told me that he was very young in the age of his life , and he told me that he was very young in the age of his life , and he told me that he was very young in the age of his life , and he told me that he was doing a great job of his life , and he said , " he said , " he was so young to him , and he told me that he was very young in the age of his life , and he told me that he was very young in the age of his life , and he
And that 's why the students who have learned at the time , and the streets of the Wall Street and the future , it 's important for him .
And if it was someone said to me , " I believe that this is a smart thing that I might like to say if I 'm going to take away from my family , or whatever I 'm going to have , or what I 'm doing in my life , and I 'm going to tell you what I 'm going to do , and how I 'm going to get out of my life , why am I going to take care of my life , or whatever I 'm going to have , and say , " I 'm going to be able to figure out how I 'm going to get out of my life , and I 'm going to tell you what I 'm going to do , and how I 'm going to get out and get your hands on my life , or whatever I 'm going to have , and say , " I 'm going to be able to figure out how I 'm going to get out of my life , and I 'm going to tell you what I 'm going to do in my life ,
And I didn 't know , I don 't know , I don 't know how to say , and I 'm not aware of the fact that the UNK have the first movement that it 's going to be .
And I didn 't know if the second thing was UNK .
UNK is not the home , and I 'm going to tell you how to get your family , and say , " Hey , why don 't you get your attention to your own life , and say , " I 'm going to leave you from your family , and I 'm going to leave you to get your family , and I 'm going to leave you from my family , and I 'm going to leave you to get your family , and I 'm going to leave you from my family , and I 'm going to leave you from the end of your family , and I 'm going to leave you with your family , and I 'm going to leave you with your family , and I 'm going to leave you with your family , and I 'm going to leave you from the end of your family , and I 'm going to leave you with your family , and I 'm going to leave you from the end of your family , and I 'm going to leave you with your family , and I 'm going to leave
And the fact is , unfortunately in a Friday afternoon and tell him , I told him to go to his job , and he said to him , and he said , " I 'm going to leave his time , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to leave his life , and I 'm going to
And at the time , what I really wanted to do was leave the New York City just to leave my loved job , but I think I need to do something I 'm going to do , and so I 'm thinking , I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going to leave the job , and I 'm going
And I thought that I was stuck with crazy love , and I had no idea that I was able to figure out that I was able to figure out what to do with my body , heart and economics .
And the third stage in health care is to spread up against violence .
And this is what I came up with .
And we just moved to the New York City -- I thought , " Well , I think it should be secure enough -- he 's going to buy a lot of guns -- he 's going to buy a lot of guns .
There 's an UNK box in the car .
I 'm going to put my hands on the table , and the third one is going to be in the pocket .
And he said that his brain feels like he needed some guns .
UNK his own security .
And the gun is a clear signal for me , even though he 's not going to throw a dog on me , and I 'm a little bit of trouble in danger .
The first time I was in front of our wedding and four days ago .
And it was early in the morning , and I was eating it .
I 'm working on a computer , and I 'm going to go out of my own career , and I 've got some UNK , and I 've got some UNK , and I 'm not able to get rid of my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head , and I 'm not going to throw myself into my head
Five days later , a 10 fingers on the one hand , and I took him in my mom 's mother , and I bought him to him .
And even though I happened , I still believe that we could be happy life , because we like each other .
And he 's really fascinated by this .
He 's just so strong , so he 's a UNK , and my family 's come to let him get away from his family 's hands .
This is a sentence , and he 's not going to hurt me .
And on the age of March , I was just two .
And for the first time , I was driving to look at the UNK coast , and I was making a bow on my knee , and he was so good that I could just be able to get the lights on my foot .
But a few days later , after the UNK and his brother , he was very depressed in his hands , and he made a cold face on my face .
When I was with two and a half years on my life , I could say two and a half times a week .
And I 've always been able to just tell you a few people that I 've ever done .
In fact , one third of American women in three countries have a vision of violence and potential for survival , and a half million children per year , and it 's 15 million children per year , and there 's about 50 million people every year , and we 're saving every 15 million children per year , and 15 million of them are saving every year , and 15 million of them are saved every year , and 15 million people are born every year , and 15 million of them are saving every year , and 15 million people are born every year , and 15 million of them are saving every year , and 15 million people are born every year , and 15 million of them are saving every year , and 15 million people are born every year , and 15 million of them are saving every year , and 15 million people are born every year , and 15 million of them are saving every year , and 15 million people are born every year , and 15 million of them are saving every year , and 15 million people are saving every
So the truth is , I 'm not an example .
So let 's go back to my question : Why am I going to leave it ?
And the answer is very simple .
I don 't know that he 's going to me .
Even though he took his head with his hands , he took me back up the stairs , and we were waiting for a dog , and I 've never been able to do it with myself , and I 've never been able to get your hands on my own hands .
The other thing is that I 'm a very difficult woman to love this woman that I love in my life , and I 'm the only person in the world to help people who care about it .
And the other question that you want to ask is , why not stop there ?
I don 't get away . I have a chance .
For me , this is one of the most difficult things that I 've ever been , and I 'm sure , you can 't understand , but only one of the problems that we can get away from our victims .
Because the last step in the family is killing her .
And 70 percent of the families who are killed by 70 percent have happened to be left , and after all , because the nurses have no budget .
And the other thing that could have happened to the end of it , even though it was time to go , and even though they were going to be able to do the same thing that the people were going to do with their hands , they were going to be able to get out with her child 's disease and her children who are going to be treated by the state of the family who are going to get to say that they 're going to take care of the people that they 're talking about , and those kids are going to go to the state and her children , who 's going to say that they 're going to take care of your family 's disease , and say that the children are going to be the same as likely to have a problem with a family , and a child who 's going to be able to take care of attention to the family , and the kids are going to go to the state and her children , and the people that often come up with the idea that there 's going to be
Now we still ask , why was she running away ?
And I decided to leave because of the last time I could get the limits that I could get stuck .
I realized that I 'm not going to attack myself , and I 'm afraid that I 've been so young to be able to kill me .
And so I broke the silence .
And I 'm going to all of you : the police , the police , my friends and family , all of us , and I 'm here to be here today , because of all of you guys help me .
We tend to be able to get the victims of people who are going to become the victims of UNK , just like the ones in the face of the news .
" Why do she need ? " to ask this question .
Some people are saying , " That 's her own , " it 's like a woman who 's like a victim , and it 's kind of like the nurses who have sex with their men .
But " UNK , " for the first time , a lot of men and women and I told them about their lives , and they 're happy about their lives , and they 're so happy that they 're going to tell people , they 're going to tell people , they 're going to go to school , they 're going to tell people , they 're going to go to school , they 're going to go to life , and they 're going to go to life , and they 're going to go to life , and they 're going to get a long job of life , and that 's what I 'm going to tell you about my life , who 's going to go to school , and to live in the work of life , and that 's what I 'm going to tell you about my life , who 's going to die out of life , and that 's what I 'm going to tell you about my life , who 's going to die in life , and say , " Hey , " is where I 'm
In fact , I 'm a typical family , and I 'm a typical family , and I 'm a typical family .
I was married with a UNK , and I married a third child .
I raised a black UNK , and I built a UNK UNK .
And I never would never have it again , and I 've never been there a pair of pants on my head for my head .
And at that point , you might think , well , this is an amazing idea , and she 's like , " Oh , that 's her , " but in the process , I 'm talking about you about the process , but by the process , " but in the process , I 'm talking about you about the process .
I 'm sure that now in the audience that I 'm talking about people who are really afraid of God , who are the ones that have died , or who 's been diagnosed , or who 's been a victim , or a child or a child , if you 're a victim or an hour or a child or a child , or you 're a UNK .
UNK could happen in your daughter , your daughter , your best friend .
And I could tell you the stories of what 's called the crazy word " story .
Today , I 'm still going to get stuck .
And this is the kind of thing I 'm helping to help other people , and the same thing that I 'm going to ask you today .
I 'm going to tell you about what you 've heard today .
UNK only live in silence .
You have the ability to make sure that your family has a little bit more than a UNK .
And we need everyone who needs everyone help .
And we need you to pick up a secret to your family .
And with your children , your colleagues , your friends and family , tell you this thing is going to take away from the other part .
I 'm going to help people who come up with a great job and be proud of the future , and they 've got the future and the future and the future .
You know , the probability of the power of violence is really going to happen , and the likelihood that there are so many of the things that they 're able to get away from the situation that we can get away from the situation that we can get away from the situation that we can get away from the situation that we have .
So let 's take a way of hands , and our bed and our family are going to be the security and the Pacific City .
Thank you .
When I was a child , I knew that my country is the best to the world in the world , and I said , " This is the one that I 've learned to do with " UNK . "
I was very proud of it .
In schools , we spend a lot of time to learn from the future , but we never never seen a world about the United States and Europe and Japan .
Although I was able to communicate the world outside the world , I thought that I 'm going to change a lot of my life just by thinking about everything .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first job , but I think I 'm very happy in my life .
My family is poor .
But by the day one day , my mom gave a letter , from her sister 's sister .
And it said to me , " When you read this letter , my home five of my family will be left because of the last two weeks .
And we 're lying on the floor on the ground , and we 're all tired of bad things , and we 're all tired of each other . "
I was very surprised .
And this is the first time I 've heard about my country in my country .
And before that later , when I was walking into a train , I saw a very painful thing .
A UNK girl is lying on the ground , and all of a sudden child child , who a child might be thinking about his mother 's face .
But nobody can help them , because of all of the family and their family and their families .
And in the late ' 90s , there were a severe famine in the ' 90s .
And unfortunately , more than a million people were killed in their lungs and die and have a lot of people who were eating , and the UNK and the trees .
UNK are becoming more UNK , and there are all kinds of things that are going to fall around the place because of the river , and the water that he 's going to go to the river in the back of the country .
I often think why they have the lights . We don 't .
This is a satellite star , and it 's a little bit of the rise of the United States and the rest of the world .
This is the UNK , and it 's part of the Middle East .
And as you can see , this river is very dense in some places , and it 's not going to spread from the country from China to China .
But a lot of people who are trying to die out .
Sometimes I saw the whole thing on the water .
I can 't tell you how long I 'm going to go out of the time , but I can say that that 's one of the most difficult years in the storm , and I 'm sent to China .
And I thought I was just a short time with my family .
But I never thought that after 14 years , we were able to get involved in the fourth four years .
And in China , I became a very young girl in my country .
I don 't know if I 'm going to die in a place like this is something I 'm going to tell you about what I 'm going to say , but I 'm just going to realize that 's going to be a dangerous thing , because you can 't really care about it , because it 's not as bad as dangerous as people in China , because it 's not a very dangerous thing , because you don 't have a problem that doesn 't have a lot of danger , because the HIV is very , very hard to see the politics of the Chinese care .
So I 'm always living in fear , and I 'm afraid that my identity will be found , and I would be able to send back to death .
And one day , my worst birthday dream is really , and I was attacked by the Chinese police , and I 'm talking to police as a police officer .
I 'm talking about sex , so I 'm talking about food , so I 'm going to try to get my voice in the police , and I asked a lot of questions about it .
And I was so scared of my mind that I was so scared of fear of fear of fear .
If there 's anything like this , I 'm going to go back into the prison and sent back .
I 've done this for my life , and as well as I am , I 'm trying to hide the fear of fear and respect , and answer their questions .
And later , a police said to another person said , " The answer is wrong .
She 's not talking about people . "
And they took me . It 's a miracle .
A few people in China in China to look for UNK , but a lot of people were attacked by the Chinese police .
These girls are lucky .
Even though they were caught , but they 've got a huge deal of governance , and they 're finally released .
But there are some people who don 't have a lot of people .
Every year , less than the Chinese population were killed in China , and when they get away from the end of the country , they 're UNK or UNK or UNK .
Even though I 'm so lucky enough to be able to leave in a place , I don 't have a lot of different kinds of cells that don 't have this kind of thing .
And it 's a terrible fact , that 's what people must get from the ground , and as a result , it 's just for the rest of the life that it 's going to survive .
Even if they 're going to be able to learn , find a job , and they have a whole world around the world .
That 's why , in UNK , I 've decided to fail to go to Korea and say , " again , I just started a new life .
It 's more difficult than what I think will be even more difficult than I 'm thinking about .
English is so important in Korea , and so I 've got to start to learn the third words . English .
And again , I realized that China has a huge difference in the United States .
And even though we are all about UNK , but we 're very different than we 're getting very different from UNK years .
I 've even been through the UNK of my identity .
And I 'm talking about Korea , and I 'm like , " Right ? "
Where did I go from ? Who am I ?
Suddenly , I 'm so sure that if I believe in my own country , I believe in my own country .
I 'm not going to do anything about Korea , but I 'm not going to do it .
So let 's learn how to do it .
When I started making my life on my life , I came up with an amazing call .
So the government has taken away from home , to my home , to my family , and my family was able to spread , to get to the place in the village .
They have to go away , so I start to help them out .
UNK are used to freedom that have never been used .
If you look at the rest of the situation in the United States and in Korea , you know , " UNK , " which is , I 'm going to go to the Chinese and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the border and go back to the edge and go back to the edge and go back to the edge and go back to the edge and go back to the edge and go back to the edge and go back
Because my family doesn 't understand the Middle East , so I 've got to help them live in China in China .
We have a week of four and a week later on the UNK .
And again , we were sitting with a guy who was very UNK , a Chinese warning .
And he looked at everybody else , and they started asking questions .
For my family , I 'm afraid I 'm going to be caught .
So when the Chinese police came up to my family , I could just tell him to tell him that this guy was a victim , and I was a nurse .
He looked at me , and he said , he believed him .
So we could get into old lives , and I was able to do it all the time to get rid of the police care as well .
And even though we had done this , my family was able to get into the care , and they were caught up to jail .
When I was UNK and UNK , my family would be released by a month , but a few years later , and they 're caught up and down .
That was one of my most worst moments of my life .
I 've made my family free to get out of my family , and the people 's going to be successful , and they 're not going to go out and go out and go on top of them .
I 'm saving the police and the police , and I 'm going to let them go over , and I 'm going to let them save , but don 't have enough money , but I 've already got enough money or money .
I was so cold .
And at that time , I heard a lot of people ask me , " What do you do ? "
I 'm a little UNK , an extraordinary strangers , and it 's all about people .
I use the English version for free , and I 'm not going to tell you about the fact that person 's going to go out and say the cost of all the rest of the people who are going to go to school , and the person who 's going to go out and say the cost of all of the rest of the people who are going to go to school , and the person who 's going to go out and say the cost of all of the rest of the people who are going to go to school , and the person who 's going to go out and say the cost of all of the rest of the people who are going to go to school , and the people 's going to pay for the rest of the rest of the people who are doing the rest of the family who are going to take care of the rest of the rest of the people who are going to go out and say the cost of all the rest of the people who are going to go to school .
I really appreciate it , and I said , " Why do you need to help me ? "
" I 'm not paying to help you , " he said .
" I 'm helping people with people . "
And I realized that that was an idea of my life .
And the great man who believed me most of what most people want to be , and he made me understand , and the people who were most people who wanted to be the hope that people want to get away from the people who need to be more of what we want to do .
And eventually , when I went through a long trip , I was back in Korea in Korea , but it was just as much as a war that 's just a war that 's happened .
A lot of time people and their families , and when they come from new countries , they often have a lot of money , or something different from them .
So we could be able to communicate the world to help education , English , education , and all of a sudden .
We can also be able to live the world between the world and the people in the dark , because we have a lot of people who are living with the people who are left with the information that we 're giving to change .
I was so fortunate , and as a child , I 've learned a lot of help of life , so I want to help people who care about the people who want to be happy .
And I 'm sure that you 'll see more and more of the world in the world , including TED , including TED .
Thank you .
You might probably agree with this road .
It 's an UNK , and it 's a very good material , but it 's not just like God 's weather , and it 's not just like the weather ; it 's not like the weather ; it 's not like the weather ; it 's not always like the weather , but it 's not just like the weather ; it 's not like the weather ; it 's not like the weather ; it 's not like the weather ; it 's not like the weather , and it 's not always like the weather , and it 's not always like the weather ; it 's all time you want to come here today .
There 's a lot of water on the road .
And the answer is that if you 're walking on your bicycle , it 's not very good enough for the cars .
At the same time , they 're going to have a lot of noise .
And it 's a kind of a material that 's kind of a material that if we 're trying to move away from the streets , like the UNK are , we 're going to be very careful about .
And the solution is to be able to UNK UNK .
These are the UNK , which are UNK , and it 's kind of a little bit of UNK on the ground , and there 's a lot of UNK to it , and it 's not easy to get on the ground , and it 's not going to be easy , and it 's not going to be easy , and it 's not going to be easy , and it 's not going to be easy , and it 's not going to be easy , and it 's not going to be easy , and it 's not going to be easy , and there 's not a lot of water .
It 's going to disappear in these UNK .
Because there 's a lot of space , and there 's a lot of noise , so there 's a lot of calories .
And of course , it 's the bad thing , and the bad thing about this road is that the police can get away .
What 's called UNK ? Look at the end of the road on the road .
I 'm going to start a few , and I started a couple of them , and then -- again -- I just don 't show it .
But they lose the UNK glass , and you 're sorry .
And finally , it can bring more and more damage .
Sometimes there 's an UNK going on the road .
Well , he 's got ready .
UNK will become the problem , but we have a solution .
Here you see the damage on the material .
This is UNK , as I said , a little bit of UNK .
And since the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK and the UNK structure , they spread out .
If you were to get out of this road , you 'll get all of these materials -- that 's what we saw .
To solve this problem , we think of ourselves .
If we could make this material , there could be a solution .
So what we do is we use the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , and we make these little UNK , and we put these little UNK UNK .
So there 's some little UNK in UNK right now .
You need a kind of like this machine , and it can be used to cook .
UNK can be UNK . It 's very good for the UNK .
So what we 're going to do is I 'm going to build a piece of UNK , and I 'm going to get the UNK , the UNK will get into the little UNK , and then you get into the UNK and you get caught up .
There is no way to be up with the power of electricity , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm here , and I 'm going to show you
UNK are like UNK .
I took it into it , and now it 's going to look what he 's going to look like .
This is what it looks like now .
We have industrial tools to work in the lab .
And we tested a lot of diversity , and we saw a lot of them , and they decided , " This is a lot of fun , we should try it . "
And the government has saved a high-speed highway to us , and we 're doing a small job in UNK , and we 're doing a material test .
And that 's what we 're doing , and we 're seeing the experiment here , and that 's not going to be bad , and we 're actually doing this for a few years .
And we did a lot of work in the course of the lab in the lab .
We 've done an old experiment , and we have a lot of them , and we use them to bring them to heat , to bring them to heat and to try and test that .
We can do more about it .
And in fact , this experiment really came out of the fact that if we spend a UNK with four years ago , at the end of our four years , we 're able to drive the technology on this four years , and then we 're spending a lot of money on the planet , and we 're spending a lot of money on the planet , and we 're going to spend a lot of money in the last four years , and we 're spending a lot of money in the last four years , and we 're spending a lot of money in the last four years , and we 're spending a lot of money in the last four years , and we 're spending a lot of money in the last four years , and we 're spending a lot of money in the last four years , and we 're spending a lot of money in the last four years , and we 're spending a lot of money in the last four years , and we 're spending a lot of money in the last four years , and we 're spending
So , it turns out that we made a kind of material that we made a material that we could use the impact that we use , and we can make a lot of energy on it , and we can make a lot of energy on it .
And you might wonder if it 's going to work .
Let 's look at this . And now it 's kind of cool .
In fact , I want to let it be so cold that it can be used to all of you .
But let 's try it !
See , yeah , yeah .
Thank you .
I 'd like to tell you about a very unusual animal .
There are about a million species on the planet .
UNK is one of the poorest extinction of the face .
Every time you look at the surface , and it 's just like , you know , first of all , this is something you 're going to eat in your brain , and it 's a little bit uncomfortable , something that 's going to hurt the people that are going to eat and say , " You know , you know , something that 's going to hurt you in the brain , and that 's something that 's so afraid of you , and that 's something that 's going to hurt the people in your head , and it 's something that makes people hate , and that 's the fear of the UNK , you can 't tell people who 's going to get the people who are going to get the people who don 't want to get the people that want to get the people who want to get the people who want to get the people who want to get the people that want to get the people who want to get the people who want to get the people who want to get the people who want to go to the
I wanted to change this way . I wanted to change the bad idea that people were doing , because they needed us . And they really need it .
Let me tell you why .
Well , why do they give us this UNK ?
UNK UNK was invented in UNK , and he found the UNK , and he said , " These are the people who are UNK in the dark , and when they say , " These are the people that are stuck in the dark , and when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they say , " These are the people that we 're talking about , when they 're
You 're very hard to find more vulnerable than this , and this is what Charles Darwin said .
You know , Darwin 's coming back from the United States and change him by telling you why I 'm going to tell you why .
UNK were seen by Ireland . It 's like a chicken dog , and it 's been UNK , and it 's called UNK .
And recently , first of all , if you want to tell you about Kenya , in Kenya , the state of the state are UNK UNK and UNK , but I like to call it the UNK .
I 'm going to make it clear . Do you know why ?
Because the Congress , they can 't be able to protect the environment .
They can 't stop the disease .
It 's almost ignored a husband .
And they were completely extinct .
And the thing that I like to do is you have a lot of people who 's doing well .
There are two UNK of this world .
New Guinea is all over the continent of Africa , like the UNK and the UNK , and all of the other species are at the end of the planet , and that 's 11 percent of the risk that they have in the middle of all that there .
So why is it important to say that ? Well , first of all , UNK has to do something more important than that . " And they 're really important to do it . "
UNK are our nature of nature .
And they could put the meat on the surface of his body .
They could lose all the bacteria in the body , and they can get rid of the viruses that can stop the virus and the animal that are going to die from the virus that we can get away from the disease and the animal that are dying from the rest of the virus .
And the latest research is shown that none of the places that don 't have any time , these are the ones that go down to those who don 't get up with the disease for HIV and growth for the disease for the disease .
There 's a lot of history , and there 's a lot of history .
But they are all related to them and ancient culture .
UNK is the same as the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and
In India , it 's called UNK , and he 's going to have a problem that he 's going to die from 10 to 10 years of UNK , and he 's going to save the Queen of UNK .
In Brazil , it 's very important to grow the time , and there 's some sort of thing in the world that don 't have the trees , and there 's no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are no trees , and there are
So how about the UNK ?
There are eight UNK , and there are six species of UNK .
A lot of UNK are killed by the virus , because of the fact that we 're doing right now where we 're doing right now , where people who are using their animals to get the animals that are going to take care of people who are the ones that are going to take care of the people who are doing the things that they 're doing when they 're doing the things that they 're doing right now , and when we make drugs , we use them to take care of food , and then we get a UNK to it .
And in South Asia , some countries like India and Pakistan , which means that they 're not going to be able to spend the last 10 years , because they 're going to be able to spend the last 10 and a half of those people in the last 10 years , and that 's because they 're going to be able to spend the last 10 and a half of the years that they 're going to spend the last 10 years , and that 's because they 're going to be able to spend the last 10 and a half of the years that they 're going to die in the last 15 years , and that 's because they 're going to be able to spend the last 10 and a half of the years that they 're going to spend the last 10 years , and that 's because they 're going to be able to spend the last 10 and a half of the years that they 're going to die in the last 15 years , and that 's because they 're going to be able to spend the last 10 years of
Now there are these UNK drugs that have been used to spread through India , and the Chinese government has a positive attitude .
Because the UNK of UNK , the UNK that are starting to grow up in the wild world , are the ones that are UNK in the storm , the UNK , the virus that 's going on fire , and there 's a huge amount of attacks , and there 's a huge amount of blindness that 's going on in the wild , and there 's a huge amount of blindness that 's going on in the wild , and there 's a huge amount of HIV in India that 's going on in the storm , and there 's a huge amount of blindness that 's happening in the face , and there 's a huge amount of blindness that 's going on in the wild , and there 's a huge amount of blindness that 's going on in the wild , and there 's a huge amount of HIV in India that 's going on in the storm , and there 's a huge amount of blindness that 's happening in the face , and there 's a huge amount of HIV in India that 's going on in the storm , and there 's
Kenya is going to have the most UNK in Africa : UNK UNK in UNK , and they 're going to be able to use the UNK .
I 'm not talking about how to make the wind , but we should be willing to convince government to consider this decision because the wind will take birds to the birds and the UNK will get the UNK and the UNK are going to make the end of the birds , and it 's about two million people who are going to do things like UNK .
They 're always UNK UNK .
In West Africa , some people who are poor are really bad about the UNK and the demand they need .
What are we doing right ? We 're studying these UNK . We 're using them .
And we 're trying to figure out the relationship between the environment and the environment .
And we found that they were all different countries in different countries , and if it were to focus on the neighborhood , you can 't get a hard time to do it .
We need to go with the entire communities .
We 're trying to communicate with local communities .
We 're trying to figure out how to spread the negative , and to get them out of all the amazing things and why they make the amazing things that they do .
What are you going to do ? You can do the same thing , and you can tell you about the people who are going to tell you about what they 're doing , and say , " You know , you can tell the people who 's going to tell you about what 's going on , and you can tell the people who are going to tell you where the people are , and the people who are going to tell you about what they 're doing , and say they 're going to talk about the people that are going to tell you about what they 're doing , and they 'll tell you what they 're doing , and we 're going to tell you about what they 're doing , and they 'll tell you what they 're doing , and we 're going to tell you about what they 're doing , and they 'll tell you what they 're doing , and we 're going to tell you what they 're doing , and they 'll tell you what they 're doing , and they 'll tell you what they 're doing ,
When you go into this room , you 're like UNK , and you 're going to tell you where your neighbors are talking about , and they tell you about where they are .
These are the UNK , and Charles Darwin said that he changed his vision , and he saw them in the air , and then he looks at the UNK UNK of his body .
Kenya , all the world 's going to have a lot of damage , and we lose all of these amazing species .
Thank you so much .
People around us can take a lot of ways to make our lives better .
We don 't think that our neighbors are just as much as our neighbors , even though we are living in the same room , and we 're basically UNK .
So in the last couple of years , I 've tried to do different ways of paper and UNK and UNK with these simple tools in public space .
What are all of these projects with my own personal questions like my neighbors ?
How do we get some other things that are going to spread out of the neighborhood and avoid the fact that they don 't have the same time , when they start to get the bad stuff on time ?
How do we get a better share about being able to get rid of the buildings that we 've made out of the building that we 're getting into here ?
How can it be more like to tell us that we need to communicate our community to our community and our community ?
I was living in New Orleans , and I lived the city in New York City .
There 's a whole bunch of UNK trees that are able to get me out of my own life , like a few years , a little bit of a UNK or a UNK , a place where they 're all happy to me , and they 're all in the trees and I 'm talking about the city that I 'm interested in and on the other side of my life .
When I was a UNK , I felt like UNK UNK to another team .
UNK have the most beautiful buildings in the world , and at the same time , she was the most UNK city in the world .
And I lived in this room , and I wanted to figure it out to be a better place for the community that lived in this community .
In 2009 , I lost a guy in my love .
And her name was UNK , and she said to me , she was like my mom , and she was very , very ill , and no one had ever done .
And then I thought a lot about how death is about death , and then I 'm making it so that I 'm going to tell you how to me , and that 's what my life has to do with my life .
But I 'm very difficult at the moment of life in our life .
And I think people are very easy to date forever , and forget what 's really important about that is important .
I was in some new old friends , and I made a whole bunch of house that I made up with a giant UNK , and I said , " Well , you know , I 'm going to tell you a whole bunch of people who are going to be able to share with them in public space , and I want to share a lot of people in the room , and I 'm going to tell you all the UNK stuff that 's going to be brought up in public space , and I 'm going to share a lot of people in the room , and I 'm going to tell you all the UNK stuff that 's going to be brought up in public space , and I 'm going to share a lot of people in the room , and I 'm going to tell you a little bit of where they 're going to get to get a pair of people in public space , and I want to share a lot of people in the room , and I want to share a little bit of some people who are going to
Well , I don 't know what to do from this experiment , but the next day , the next two days , are surrounded by people , and they have the answer to the new answer .
I 'd like to share with you some people who are in the wall .
" When I wanted to do this , I wanted to be a UNK for my UNK . "
" I want to end in the last two years . "
" I want to do this for a million people a few years ago . "
" I want to get a tree before I die . "
" On the dead , I want to get away . "
" I want to leave you with a time ago . "
" As a child , I wanted to be a man . "
" I want to make a real time at the end of my life . "
And the one that came out of the place that became a very important place , and my hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the hope , the vision of my experience ,
And it makes us believe that we 're not alone .
Let 's get the new thing about our neighbors to our neighbors .
And it 's a place that we 've been able to make a difference between change and thinking , but what we 're doing is what we 're doing , what 's the most important thing that 's going to change the process of change , and what we 're doing is the most important thing to change .
And this red is about something I did last year , and I 've not been able to get some good people in my community , and I said , " This is going to be a small group of people in their community , and I 'm doing a little bit of my colleagues right now , and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in my community -- and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in my community , and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in my community , and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in my community , and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in my community , and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in my community , and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in my community , and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in my community , and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in my community , and I 'm doing a little bit of mine in the community , and they 're doing a little bit of a small group of
And these are the signs that if we could have a sense of being able to share the opportunity of sharing the tools and share the tools that we want to share .
All of the most expensive things we have , and one of them is time to do one thing about the other person .
In the process of this kind of sense of thinking , one of the things that everyone 's trying to do is to take away from this system , which is more important than any other person 's lives .
We all don 't have the courage to say that death is even worse than death , but I realize that the most powerful thing we could do to do is what we can do to do about the most powerful things that we can do .
I think that the death of death can be able to tell you how to do it .
The public spaces have better to what we really are really important for , and we 're not able to get a good place for them , fear and experience that we don 't need to help us get better lives for the whole community .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I was in the UNK in California , and I was on top of a virus called UNK .
The air was hot . It was UNK . It was very painful .
And I can think of that as being able to get out of the people who are in the face , but in a dark dark , I don 't see anything else .
I hear people who are talking to them , but more of them is the sound of UNK , UNK and UNK .
For everyone else , I put the UNK on top of a UNK with a UNK UNK with a UNK UNK that I was able to get up to the side of the wall .
So , I took a hand , and I wanted to get some of the UNK that I 've ever seen before I was there .
And when I 'm here today talking to you today , these are the ones that are going to happen to you that are dangerous , and they 're not UNK , and they 're okay , and they 're all bad and bad .
And then I ended up with the UNK , and these are the ones that were never going to go away from the day .
In the last two years , I 've been working on the record of the New York Times , and in 2009 , in 2009 , in 2009 , in 2009 , I was very happy to be able to grow up the place in the end of the country , and in 2009 , in 2009 , in 2009 , in 2009 .
And I met a lot of people who met a lot of people who know that I knew a lot of people who were working in the United States , and we know that this organization is based on the basis of modern modern society .
We talked about UNK , and I actually started to understand the reality of the situation , and I 've always been able to know how to do it , and I 've always been able to know how to do it .
And at the end of our talk , I felt like a really bad idea of what I felt like , and why do I not know how to do this so that I don 't know how much of this is going to work .
And the idea that came out to me was just a few weeks later , and I was able to go to Boston , and I was there to get a lot of people called UNK UNK , who wanted to be able to figure out what to do with them .
So this is what I began to do with a modern disaster journey .
UNK , places where I was .
Well , I 'm not even given them to my second generation .
But this time , I 'm going to look at the secret that you can 't get out with .
There are more than 70 million people in the world today .
And this number is the equivalent of UNK in Africa in Africa , and it 's twice as 20 percent of the breast .
150 years ago , a farmer who was very UNK in the United States spent about the United States in the United States for about 10 years of the United States .
You know , it 's about five million dollars today .
But today , there 's a whole family in the future of our lives , and there are only 18 dollars of consumer .
And the amazing thing about all of this is that we are at a global economy per year over the last 10 years .
Most of them were being UNK , and good enough , good jobs would be able to do so well , and good jobs were going to be able to do so well , and they 're not going to get rid of the benefits of violence , and they can 't escape from it .
It 's a value that 's made as good as we have as people who work on business , but what they want on the cost is what they 're doing .
UNK have almost every single majority of the world , even though it doesn 't matter any place .
In India and Tanzania , I was brought in UNK .
So there 's a lot of the scene that there are so many different things that are going to happen to be like , but of course they 're talking about the hell that they 're talking about .
You know , in 50 UNK , women , women , and indeed , there are a whole lot of people on the top , and they 're up and down , and up and down , you know the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK -- the UNK
UNK and UNK were so slow , and as a child , they lived around a day of six and a half a day .
It 's not going to be saving , and they don 't eat water because they don 't need water water ; they don 't need a toilet .
Because there was this hot hot and UNK that I could not be able to do .
Every 20 minutes later , I 've got to get away out of my equipment , and I 'm going to put it in the air , and I 'm going to put it in a car , and it 's going to be as if it 's going to be more of the people that are living in the room , and it 's going to be as important as people who are in the cars , and they 're better than they 're on the cars , and they 're better with the people who are in the cars , and they 're better than they 're on the planet , and they 're better with the people who are in the cars , and they 're better than they 're on the planet , and they 're better than they 're on the planet , and they 're better with the people who live in the cars , and they 're better with the people who are in the cars , and they 're better than they 're on the planet , and they 're better than they 're on the planet , and they 're better
And back in the middle room , I 'm not thinking , but I 'm not going to cry , but I 'm going to die for the rest of my life , and I said , " UNK , don 't cry , don 't cry . "
And he said to me to explain that what 's happening in this place that is dangerous is dangerous , and it 's dangerous to me , and that 's the kind of people that are going to say to me , and that 's the kind of people that are going to say to me , who 's going to work with them .
I 'm not going to let them support for the help .
I can 't give them less money . I don 't do anything .
I 'm not the state of this country .
I do so well that there 's a way for them to get them wrong .
And I just can tell you that I can tell you that the UNK UNK can be able to tell me that they can do it .
So I said , I 've got to wait later later , and you can do it yourself .
And in the Himalayas , I saw a lot of hard , and I saw it all the way down the mountain in the middle of the road , and they 're waiting for their UNK .
These UNK are the ones who are the ones on the train , and the kids are going to do the trees , the UNK , the UNK UNK , and the UNK that UNK the UNK to the rest of us .
And it seems like a really painful thing to look like this is just a very painful experience .
How can we be able to predict what they 're talking about , but what does sex mean " and " right ? "
And some people don 't even think that they 're being killed by seven days a day , and they 're not going to die as a half a day , because they 're going to be like this day .
There 's not any of it .
And if these guys were forced to run out of their homes , they were able to do all the houses .
These people don 't have a bad time , and they want to get rid of them , but the people in the photo are trying to afford to pay for a place like the UNK , and they 're going to be able to do the same thing , and they 're going to be able to do the same thing that they 're going to do , and they 're going to be able to do something that 's going on in the ground , and they 're going to be doing the same thing that they 're doing , and they 're going to be able to do something that 's going on in the ground , and they 're going to be able to afford to do it , and they 're going to be able to do something that 's good for them , and that 's what they 're doing , and they 're going to be able to do the same thing , but they 're going to be doing the same thing that they 're going to do , and they 're going to be able to afford to survive , and
UNK are the most important thing that we 've been hearing when we 're listening to our parents , and I 've always been told to say , " Well , I 've been so excited to be able to get this job out of all of this stuff . "
It 's all about the people that have ever been UNK before .
And they brought me down to the next UNK building on the hot side .
This is a room today .
It 's more like a restaurant .
UNK restaurants are known as well known as people who sold it .
A small group , and women and children have only seven and a half percent of the kids who are saving their food and drink more of them .
Every small area is very dark , and there 's a number of UNK and UNK and UNK .
People in this room are really happy for the victims of our victims .
And remember , it 's almost as if it 's almost a black hole in the face , and I think that there 's a lot of fear of fear that I 've been thinking about what 's going on in this room .
And here 's one thing : this is me .
There was no other door .
There 's no window room .
These people are completely unable to get out of such a hard problem that we face so many of the challenges that we face are , where we don 't understand where the time are , and if you don 't know they are , you know , there 's something right wrong in our backyard .
There were thousands of people who were going to be an UNK , family 's job , and they 're not there yet .
And recently recently , New York has 10 million dollars a year to get 18 million children every year .
These are things that happen to us , and we just don 't know .
UNK are the same thing that we 've heard when they 're having sex workers .
I 'm in India with a village where people are UNK and UNK .
This is a guy called " UNK . "
This is the black hand in the room , and the red side and the red side of the red side of the red side of the red side of the red .
They were UNK in a UNK , and then they put it in the air , and we could get rid of them , and we could get drugs out of them .
I 'm going to tell them to my story .
" We don 't have freedom . "
Maybe we 're hoping to stay away from the room and other people in the room where they 're going to be able to get money out there . "
UNK , over 400 children from UNK , are the largest living in the world .
So we got there , and we went to a big deal .
I saw it as a guy who sat on the ship , and it was a little bit of little older kids , and they 're kind of very small kids , and they 're like , " Oh , you know , something like that ?
UNK ! They 're all UNK .
Children were brought from home , and they sold on the boat , and they don 't do it on the floor , and they 're not going to swim .
This little boy is eight years old .
When our UNK came up , he was blind that he was going to put him on his knee .
He 's so scared that he 's going to fall in the water .
There are the trees in the lake that are going to go to the trees , and the hell kids are UNK to the water , afraid of the children who are going to get rid of the water that they 're going to get out of the water .
A lot of people are dead .
And from his son , he was forced to work on the lake .
And he was so scared that he was so scared of man , and he was very UNK by his hand , and he was doing a lot of his job than he was doing so much for his child .
When I was in the morning , I saw kids of these kids on the last four years , and they started working in the morning .
It 's cold cold , and it 's so cold .
Do you know that the Molas are UNK in the fish ?
I 'm going to tell you about UNK .
He 's from a village from a UNK .
So he 's seen by his UNK UNK , and he 's a place where UNK workers are doing in a place where they are in a position of UNK .
And he 's looking at the camera that he 's going to put a pair of water on the side of the UNK and the people who are going to tell you , the people who are going to be able to tell you , the people who are going to be able to tell you , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is , what they 're going to do is
UNK has an ability to happen .
And because of the fact that the person has just changed the future of his life , it could be able to change the future of his life .
UNK are going to be on a road on top of the UNK and UNK UNK , and it 's up to the car , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up the window , and it 's up with a car .
And he made him to tell him that he 's going to tell you about a UNK .
And at the end of the road , he UNK us .
And then he put on the ground and he said , " Here it is . This is it . "
We took away from a very small camp in a small way , and we took a little bit of water on the top of the top , and we took it to the top , and we took it to the top , and we put it in the top of the top , and we put it in the top of the top , and we 're able to get a piece of water on the top side of the UNK that I 've been able to do .
And then there are four little UNK that are UNK , and there 's a huge amount of holes on the ground , and there are all kinds of holes in the space , and there 's all kinds of holes in the space that we have today , and we all have a global space that all of us have , and there 's all kinds of holes in there , and there are all kinds of holes in there .
A lot of women still have their children , and they are in the water that is protected .
UNK are the ones who sell the gold .
These people who are in the UNK are UNK .
And when they get there , they 're all UNK .
I remember that they were surrounded by the eyes of red blood in their eyes , and a lot of people are living in the UNK , and many of them were killed in their UNK and a half hours and a half years ago .
These are the ones that are all over and over and over and over and over and over again , and these are the UNK that are being brought to the rest of the country .
And as seen as a result , they are living in a UNK , and we met a lot of people who have lived in the face , and there are some kids who have a problem on the ground who have gone and some children who have some children who have a problem on the ground side of the people who are working on the ground , and there are some kids who have a few lives on the ground who are living on the ground , and there are some kids who have a few lives on the ground who are living on the ground , and there are some kids who have a few lives on the ground who are living on the ground , and there are some kids who have a few lives on the ground who have found a living in the face , and there are some kids who have a problem on the side of the people who are working on the ground , and there are some kids who have found some of the workers who have a living in the back of the ground that have some children who have
These are the victims of autism .
In fact , these muscles were really likely to be as likely to someone like this person , and with the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK and the UNK .
This is Martin . And when his father died at the end of his father , he sold his job and sold his job .
And after his uncle , Dr. UNK UNK his UNK , and he was forced to continue on a farm .
And when I met him , he was working on the UNK UNK , and he 's a little bit of a UNK in a UNK , and she 's a UNK , and she 's going to be in a UNK , and that 's what 's happening in a time when he 's a UNK .
Except for this UNK , and again , it also has the same thing that he 's going to have had died every day in the morning .
Even though , he 'd like to be able to get the help out of UNK , and it 's the same thing that 's so amazing to me as well as to do so , to get a sense of what 's going on with the idea that people who don 't have so much sense that it 's going to be so good for me to think about fear .
And I hope that we 're all of the people .
And when I was flying up in my book , I brought a lot of UNK with this , and I put my camera on my head , and I was able to figure out what they were like , and when they were brought together , they were able to figure out what they were doing , and when they were brought together , they were able to figure out what they were doing , and when they were brought together , they were able to figure out what they were doing , and when they were brought together , they were able to figure out what they were doing , and when they were brought together , they were able to figure out what they were doing , and when they were brought together , they were able to figure out what they were doing , and when they were brought together , they were able to figure out what they were doing .
They know that it 's seen from the outside .
And I wanted to tell them that we could change the lives of their lives .
I do believe that when we put them together , they 're really hard to be doing something like this .
These are a lot of stories about the fact that people are about real people , and with you as a kind of authority and respect , I 'm going to get all of the rights and respect and respect to the rest of the life .
I 'm not going to think of these beautiful ones , but there are people that are so many of those people who have seen the people that I think are going to meet .
And I want these pictures to be able to do so many things like you might have sex with something you want to get a chance to think of , because of the UNK , because of the UNK , of the light that we want to live in a place like , because if you don 't want this power to be a very good version of the technology we want to be , if you don 't want to be the one that 's going to be free of the technology , because of the UNK , I hope that 's going to be the essence of the consumer 's hope , because we don 't think this is going to be the end of the consumer 's hope , because of the UNK and the UNK that the UNK can be , if you don 't have the power of the UNK , because of the UNK , of the UNK , to the people that make it as if it 's so UNK to be the UNK of a consumer , because if you don 't think of this , you know , it doesn 't
Thank you .
I mean , I 'm learning about how many of you have learned how many of them are using a special problem in math , and it 's a very special problem .
Nobody knows what we 're doing .
So I 'm going to give you some examples of what we 're doing .
Well , dancing is one of the people who live human beings .
We 'd be able to have a dance dance and a dance dance , and you 'll get it right .
Now , Chris need a really good idea of finding out with the UNK that may be , perhaps maybe what it is like , and that 's what it means to be human .
But unfortunately , the nervous system , as if it 's so successful that the HIV was slowly , as it turns out , was the result of the UNK , which is that he 's going to be able to end up with my time at the time that he 's up here , and it 's so successful that he 's from his time at the time that he 's up his time at his time , when he was one of his UNK at his age , and he was born in his day , and he was born by his friend 's UNK .
And these years later , he 's gone through a lot of different years .
However , there are about 30,000 million people in the world who have this disease , and they 're not able to do the same thing as they do , and they 're able to figure out how to do it so that we need to focus on the problem that they 're going to take care of .
And we need to focus on the idea of how we can actually change the other way that we could have access to the problem that we have to get answers to answer the problems that we have .
But the thing about UNK is that they don 't have sex disorder , they don 't have sex disorder , and you don 't have to use a system to test the brain that we could do , and that 's what we could do in the next 20 minutes of what we can do .
You 've got to go to the clinic , and it 's so valuable that you can 't get this test from the clinical trial from the clinical trial , never never done it before , and it 's never been done , and it 's never been done .
But what if the patient could do this test ?
How much of this could be able to take away from the patient 's going to run to the patient ?
I don 't need a lot of money to work .
And by the way , if you 've got to do it for a time , it 's going to be 30 dollars .
So what I 'd like to tell you about a very different way that we can try to go to the project because you know , at some point , at some point , when I 'm friends , we 're all familiar with my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of my friends , and we 're all of our friends , or
And I 've got a video of UNK UNK .
And this is something that is healthy to us , and we think , as we think , as we think , as we think , as we think , as we think , as we think , as we think , as we call them , you know , as we call them , you know , as we call them , you know , as we call them , you know , as we get out there , you know , maybe these are the UNK gene , and we 're all of these UNK genes , and we 're all of these UNK genes .
And as it works , it also needs to be able to do a special job .
So think about it , kids say they 're going to spend a lot of time .
On the radio , we 're able to figure out what 's going on with an UNK movement that can affect us , and we can all be able to get rid of our hands on our hands .
You can see the UNK is a different kind of silence .
And we saw the same thing .
UNK . UNK . UNK .
There are going to be a little bit less UNK , and there 's a lot of different things that these are the symptoms that have all of the symptoms .
And in fact , these UNK are so hard to use any of the things that we can do , but only one of the big projects that we can actually do in order to actually do something very well , and we 're going to figure out what 's going on in the front of the brain , and it 's going to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very exciting .
So they use these UNK algorithms , and they 're going to try to do the same thing , and they 're all of technology , but they 're all of technology .
There 's a lot of science , and they 're all used to use the infrastructure .
You don 't need to design a whole bunch of hospitals to do it .
And they 're very UNK , and of course , but they 're not experts in the language , but they 're not experts in the language .
That means that patients can do it yourself .
And it 's going to be as fast as fast as it is , and it 's about 30 seconds .
UNK are very low . We also know how to do it .
Once it 's cheap , it can be UNK .
So , I 've got some of the great targets here .
We can get less and less and less people together .
There must be no way to look for the clinic .
And we can run the UNK data out , and we can focus on the data as well .
We could be able to do a lot of UNK to this problem , and we can do a lot of research for the first time that we could use the number of people in the first time .
We also have the opportunity to look for this disease as the disease that 's going on the patient .
So , from the end of the day , we started talking about UNK , and we started UNK UNK .
UNK and UNK , and we just wanted to record all of the data that we 're going to get to get to these four targets for the world to get these four targets .
And we 're going to be able to compare a billion people in the planet Earth .
When the health or the people who have the HIV epidemic , it 's very cheap , and every single time , we have a lot of money that we 're going to get us in the third half of our population .
Thank you .
UNK , how many of you can tell who who is health , who are the health , who is the health ?
And how do you get out of all of this stuff ?
Right , so that 's what it 's about . You know , you 're going to have a disease , you know , if you don 't have any disease . UNK .
You know , some people might not be giving us , or nobody else .
But we 're going to be able to get bigger from different environments , and what we can do is connect to people who don 't get rid of the disease that this disease is really .
So you 've got about 75 percent of the challenges ?
It 's never gone away .
In fact , my students with my students , I 've got to tell you that he was doing this because he was able to figure out what he was doing now , and we were to figure out what was going on on the table , and now it 's going to be clear 99 percent of what we have done in our mobile phone .
UNK , well , it 's a great deal .
So this means that people could do it right now -- people could use the phone in hand , and then they could record their kids , and they 're going to figure out how to do that , and their doctors were able to figure out what they 're doing in the treatment , and they 're going to take care of this disease and they 're going to take care of this disease and they 're going to try to figure out how to treat the disease , and their doctors are going to figure out where they 're going to take care of this disease .
That 's what it 's about .
Thank you so much , UNK and all of us .
Thank you .
Since I 'm able to do so well , I 've been fascinated by my life , but today , I want to tell you about 15 years ago , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to tell you about 15 years , and I 'm going to
There 's no art ; there 's no UNK , there 's no UNK chance , and it 's not going to do things easy .
In fact , most of them are available to find out .
My story is all about one , and a week later , I invited my New York City , and my wife 's from New York City , my wife 's son , and I 'm waiting for my daughter , and her son 's room . "
And a few years later , we went back to the New York City , so we decided to take a picture of that .
And you can think of how it works .
And now four of the older days , my wife said , " Hey , why don 't you like UNK New York in New York City ? "
And it 's from here from the beginning to help us .
You know , if you look at the camera , you can tell a story that 's very unusual to it .
No one is , unfortunately , unfortunately , no one 's going to get us up .
And at that time , we didn 't know that this journey really changed our lives .
For us , it 's going to be going to be angry .
This is a couple of years after 9 / 11 , and I was trying to figure out that what he was doing about 11 years ago was going to figure out what he was thinking about 11 years ago .
So these pictures are never even recorded a moment , or a very different journey .
They are one of the things that we 've been spending on for a week , and we 're thinking about how to do it in the last year or two years , and how we evolved to change the planet , and that 's how change it 's changed .
Because I took a picture like this , and we looked at the same time , and women went to school and said , " Oh , I 've seen her eyes , you know , how to see how he 's going to look like her eyes , how he 's going to see her eyes , how he 's going to see her eyes , how he 's going to see her eyes , how he 's going to look at her eyes , how he 's going to look at her eyes like this . "
It 's our time for our time , it 's one of the most UNK times of our time .
And a recent journey on the road , and we walked on the road , and she said , " You know , she 's a little girl in the room , and she 's like , " Oh she 's a very nice time , and she said , " This is how long she 's going to be very good at the time of the week , and she 's very happy about how to do it . "
And she was five years old , and she was standing in front of his hand .
And she said , first of all the time that she wanted to get this place on the ground , he was thinking about it , and he was about nine years ago .
Now the New York is now in New York City , because she decided to go to New York .
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we 've created is that we have our memories .
So I 'd like to share with this kind of idea that there is a way to create memory .
I don 't know about you , but my family said , I 'm not going to show you where I 'm here .
I was always the person who made it .
I want to focus on how many of you have today , and I 'm going to put in my room and say , " Can we take a problem ? "
Thank you .
